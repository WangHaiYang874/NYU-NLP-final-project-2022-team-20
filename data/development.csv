626910,"ENFJs need to realize that to take care of others they need to take care of themselves. And really we empathize so much that we see a lot of good things in people who are otherwise toxic. 

I am currently going through the same phase. I emotionally invest into people who drain me. My partner is Fi dom and is teaching me to be emotionally ""selfish"" and be self aware of my toxic surrounding. This way, instead of reaching out and helping toxic people, I will be taking care of my own life and therefore magnetize good vibes people :)  I hope that over time it will work. 

My best suggestion for you is this. Suggest your ENFJ reject talking on the phone or going out with a toxic friend **at least once** and see the reaction that follows. Chances are toxic friends would get upset that their psychological charger ENFJ is busy. Whereas good friends would be happy if ENFJ is busy with chores/other friends/job/school/family etc. Toxic people would blame ENFJ (or any other type for that matter) that they haven't talked for a while and get upset.

A lot of people are attracted to the façade, and that's why many seem shallow. I think the core of hipsterism lies in being progressive and intellectually open-minded, as well as valuing individualism and independence.

Strong Fi users would be attracted to the sense of individual creativity and excitement in the new. xNTPs would enjoy the intellectual diversity and innovation. xNFJs would enjoy being involved in an emerging culture, and xNTJs would enjoy feeling superior to the masses. I cannot see xSxJs being hipsters, sorry, unless they were close to people that they could follow before it became mainstream.

I had a theory that my identified hipster thoughts may be linked with my mbti type, but I've just answered my own question. The stereotype can exist within any type, but manifests in different ways depending on the goal of the person.

1238723,"Please don't feel bad.  I appreciate you saying that, though.  It's definitely possible that I misinterpreted your original comment.  I re-read what you wrote and I don't remember why I got so annoyed in the first place lol.  I think I get annoyed by the concept of 'shadow functions' as a whole, which is pretty closed-minded and not really fair for me to do.  In my mind, I associate it with socionics, the concept of which also annoys me greatly because it seeps into the MBTI community even though they're different systems and it confuses me a lot.  Also the relationships between the types that socionics predicts (at least the charts etc. I've seen) are like...laughably wrong.

But yeah I'm now realizing that my whole frustration was because of some loose connection to some other theory that I'm annoyed with because I don't understand it and/or because it doesn't make sense (distinguishing which is usually pretty hard for me).

So my conception of the functions as a scale is not necessarily in terms of *expression*, but more in terms of...competence?  I guess I would rephrase to say it's not so much of a *model*, but rather a *metaphor*.  A young Fe dom is just learning how to recognize emotions in others, what they mean, social cues, just learning how changing their behavior can affect others, or what effect external cues have on social dynamics.  Things they have to notice and learn.  As they develop competence with that, they can start to better make predictive observations and associations between external events and their *own* feelings/values.  Eventually, they will come to be more and more proficient at identifying their own feelings and values without needing external observation or verification.  In this way, an Fe dom who has been working on development their whole life may, at some point, be as deft at Fi as others who ""start from"" that point.

So on my 1-100 scale, it may look something like (numbers are just guesses):

* Level 5: People are screaming!  Unpleasantness!
* Level 10: People are screaming!  That means they're angry!  Ahhh!  Unpleasantness!
* Level 10: People are screaming.  They're angry because I broke the dish.  Breaking dishes makes people angry.  I'll try not to break dishes.
* Level 20: People are angry because I broke the dish.  Why?  She really liked this dish.  She's sad now that it's broken.  That makes her angry.  Breaking dishes makes people sad, which makes them act angry.  I'll continue trying not to break dishes.
* Level 30: She's sad that something she liked is gone.  That's why she's yelling.  I feel sad now too, because I see how she feels.  I can't always avoid breaking dishes (Si/Ni), so maybe there's something else I can try to make her feel better?  I will try apologizing...
* Level 40: Ahhh!  You broke my dish!  ...why do you look sad?  Why are you apologizing?  Hmm.  In the past, when I apologized for breaking dishes, I felt sad too.  I remember, it's because the person whose dish I broke was acting angry, but I could tell they were actually sad.  I must be sad too?
* Level 50:  Ah!!!  You broke my dish!  I'm shouting!  That must mean I feel angry!!  No, wait, I probably actually feel sad, don't I?
* Level 60: Ah!!!  You broke my dish!  I'm angry!  No, wait, I mean, I'm sad!
* Level 70: Omg I'm so...sad that this dish is gone.  Why am I sad?  It's just a dish.  Oh yeah, I remember, my mother gave it to me.  I really loved her.  I miss her.
* Level 80: That dish was a representation of my feelings for my mother.  I miss her terribly.  That's why the broken dish made me sad, but it's not really about the dish.
* Level 90: Wow...I miss my mom.

Note that that's about the level of Fi I've personally reached (on occasion), and I'm pretty sure it's not actually 90/100 haha. It's just hard to...conceptualize?...what would be beyond that yet.

Going in the opposite direction would not be those exact words, but rather, it would be starting by identifying one's own emotions, and then seeing the cause for those emotions, and then noticing how they acted objectively in response to the emotions, and then noticing those actions in others, and then predicting causal relationships about others' emotions, and finally being able to use Fe to manage and affect others' emotions and values.

I guess the issue I have with say, the idea of an ""ignoring function"" is that implies that Fe users can *only* access Fi subconsciously or with great conscious effort, whereas my lived experience and observation is that the more mature people get, if they're healthy, they will be able to access that function more and more consciously with less and less effort.  For example, I use Fi much more in my everyday life than my Fe aux boyfriend and father do.  I am sometimes amazed when they can't recognize that they're bored, upset, nervous, etc. until I point it out to them.  I almost always recognize that I'm feeling *some* emotion, even if I have to sit and think for a moment about what it might be.  And that's also a skill - recognizing and interpreting what I feel and care about - that I've gotten better with and faster at over time.

Perhaps the 8-function model accounts for that and I am just ignorant of the theory?  I still feel myself irrationally resistant to it.  Perhaps it's also possible that I'm just using Ni + Fe on myself and it's not true Fi.  Going down that rabbit hole is difficult intellectually for me - what would be the difference?  And so on.

But I have always thought of it as just something I had to go through for the person I loved. The anxiety of not knowing what she's doing. Knowing you are waiting for the moment for her to come back and you are ready to take her in with both arms, but not knowing if she is willing to do the same. The insecurity of feeling emotionally suffocating. All of these feelings and god knows how many more I am willing to go through for her, I feel stupid while typing it out but I guess I just know most of it is just made up in my head. Or at least I hope it is. 

I don't know if I am being caught in an abusive relationship. It's hard to imagine someone you've loved for years hurting you. So I've always said it was myself. It was my insecurities, my anxiety, my emotions. I just have to find a way to deal with them.

I don't want to go on forever because I feel like it's just more important for me to say how much this post really meant to me.

115065,"My SO is an INTP and we've been together a year now. Here are a few pointers for your INTP guy:

1) Don't do small talk - they find it irritating and mundane. So forget asking what the weather is like or general chit chat or what happened on last night's episode of Eastenders - THEY DO NOT CARE!
2) The INTP's auxiliary function is Ne - they love to discover and research new ideas (and their Ti will then get them lost in said research). I'm not sure about your type, but if intuition sits high in your functional stack then discuss concepts, theories and big picture points about the world
3) show an interest in THEM. Find it more about him by asking questions about him. Even though Fe is their inferior function, they seem to have a soft spot for letting you peel the layers of their personality so that you can get into some of the deeper parts of their personality and their background
4) don't overburden him/bombard him with texts. They like their own space and if they are deep in Ti mode then they are likely to not even have registered that they have even received a text until hours later (it's nothing personal, they are just lost in thought)

INTPs are interesting, fascinating people. Do a little digging, make an effort to be open minded, find out about them and give them their space and they will give you themselves whole heartedly. ",ENFJ,249,1354,INTP

INFJs are the most interesting to me but sometimes make me uncomfortably vulnerable.  Probably because they also seem to get me the best.

INFP - I like them a lot, they don't seem very interested in me.  Good from a distance.

INTJ - Either extremely attracted to them, or extremely repulsed, depending on their values and maturity

INTPs are a blast.  Make me feel very relaxed, safe, and have good conversations.

ISFJs - it really depends on their values and open-mindedness.  Can be very deep sense of belonging and mutual understanding, or very harsh rejection.

ISFP - I like observing them and I often admire them.  They aren't very interested in me.

ISTJs - adorable and hilarious.  I get along with them really well

ISTPs - admire them from afar.  I suspect I could have an amazing friendship if I met the right one.

ENxJs - admire greatly from afar.  In many ways hit too close to home.

ESxJs - lots of butting heads.  I like some of them very much but feel very lost in the relationship.

2. COMMUNICATE. Tell him what you told us. Ask directly for whatever it is you actually want. Avoid blaming or making assumptions. Push yourself to be curious and direct - ask specific questions, and listen to the answers.  It may help you to research some communication techniques - I would start with googling ""active listening"" and ""non-violent communication"".

You show them attention and affection, they turn into puppy dogs and follow you around.  They're not going to hold your past mistakes against you - chances are they barely remember them lol.

Ways to get INFJs interested:

* Ask their opinions and advice.  ""What do you think about X?  That's interesting, why do you think that?""

* Show interest in their interests, if you're able to pry them out.

* Talk a lot about your feelings and views on life and the world.  Be a little selfish; it's okay to dominate the conversation.

* Invite them out to do fun things!!!!!  Start small (coffee shop, movie theater, museum) and build up (rock climbing! picnics! 3-day concert festivals!).  Don't take no for an answer.  I mean, you know, don't be a creep, but they're pretty easy to convince if you're charming.

* Don't worry, even though you seem different, you are inherently very attractive to the INFJ.  Make sure to pick one whose values align fairly well with yours.

They will be like putty in your hands &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

VERY IMPORTANT, feeding and watering of INFJs:

* Do NOT break the INFJ's heart.  This will ruin them forever.  Ways to break their heart include: lying to them, breaking promises, gossiping negatively about them, ghosting them.
* If you must deliver bad news, do it gently but directly.  Rip the bandaid off, be firm, but also show compassion.
* The INFJ is always thinking about many things.  It takes effort to pull it out of them.  Put in the effort.  It's worth it.
* Be cautious when teasing the INFJ.  They are more sensitive than they let on.  But they also find this behavior attractive.  It is a delicate game.
* Don't ask them to make decisions too often.  They'll prefer to follow your lead.  That said, if their mind is made up, you will have to go digging around in their mind and make a lot of effort to change it.  Gentle Ti works well in this case.
* Include them in discussions about your future.  Make them feel like you're committed to them and consider them when you make important decisions.
* Don't rely on them to remember small pieces of information or do little chores.  They'll forget and feel bad about it.",ENFJ,389,2184,mbti

I think there is truth to the idea that xNFJs are good for ISTPs, simply because you guys hate talking about your feelings so much haha.  Things that other types need verbalized are often fairly obvious to us.  What gets to me is when someone clearly feels one way and then denies it - so in the case of your SO, if I said, ""You don't care about shopping at all,"" and you were like, ""No, no, I totally love it.""  *That* drives me crazy; in my mind I'm like, 'Do you think I'm an idiot?  It's written all over your face!' But for other types who are less perceptive of people's feelings and motivations, it might be enough to satisfy them.

I wish you luck with your ESFP.  It does not sound like you find it to be very fulfilling.  But all relationships have challenges and ideally you will learn new things about yourself that can help you going forward in both being the kind of person you want to be, and knowing what you do and don't want in a partner.

My first hunch was a distinction between Fi and Fe as well.. although after thinking about it, I'm not sure your theory holds true...

As u/Destroyedintp1 said, it may be a dominant/inferior thing. I like to believe that I am skilled at both cognitive and affective empathy. For me, I don't get a choice whether I engage in affective empathy - it just hits me, and I need to help them because I feel bad *for them*. I imagine Fi would help so *they themselves* stop feeling bad? I'm not really sure there.

Cognitive does seem more on the Fe axis, especially dominant/auxiliary. Much more calculated, skilled, decisive, extroverted. Knowing how to navigate it though I think would be an Fe-Ni skill, as I feel Fe-Si struggles more. 

I think Affective is just a byproduct of being human, as we all feel the pain of others, but the *how* and *why* we want to help them are all different. My ESTJ father loves helping people! And he has inferior Fi!

Not at all!  I'm enjoying reading your answers.

1. Do you enjoy decorating your home and/or are you interested in fashion and aesthetics, getting dressed up, etc.? If so, how do you usually approach it - what do you think about, what's your goal, what are you drawn to in a store?
2. You are at a party, and everyone is relaxed, laughing, having a great time. Suddenly, someone says something weird and everyone gets awkward and quiet.  How do you feel about this situation?  How much do you want everyone to go back to being happy quickly?  Would you find it fairly easy to get everyone back into a good mood if you tried?

Im not sure if I’ve ever been good friends with any NTs, as I don’t think any of them are into debating. I think you misunderstood me when you typed, “insist that people can't be alone, that when they're busy they must crave friendship.” I don’t think everyone is waiting to be free to go see friends in the busy nature of adult life. I just mean that, even if your extremely busy, at some point in the year you will think about having human interaction outside of work. I’ve met a lot of introverts, and even if it’s not an emotional thing, they still will enjoy human interaction from time to time even though they hate leaving the house.

Maybe I am overwhelming in other ways though. I have frequently thought about all the ways where I’m the core or main contributor to the issue.

A. I take direct action to accomplish my goals and desires in the face of external obstacles, and also the interests of my close friends, family, or associates. This may involve prodding others to take necessary action, deliberately applying pressure in specific situations, or abruptly taking on an organizational role. I don't generally seek out confrontation, but I'm also not afraid of it. I take my responsibilities seriously, and I tend to perform them diligently and with care. I expect the same of others.  I'm confident of my ability to recognize and evaluate the physical condition and well-being of myself and others, aesthetic sensations, and the internal effects of sensory stimulants such as good food and relaxing situations. I can provide a convincing evaluation of these when promptedl; however, I regard soothing, relaxing things and discussions of them as sources of amusement rather than a priority in life. I don't treat them very seriously or allow myself to engage in them very often, despite my overall confidence in these areas. When I do choose to focus attention on my physical condition and well-being, I'm more likely to prefer a direct approach and impose a strict, demanding dietary or exercise regimen upon myself or others.

B. I like to apply my insight to specific situations, relating them to the bigger picture. I also enjoy discussing idealized circumstances or what could be rather than what is. Consequently, I usually have high standards, even unreasonably so, for those around me. I don't pursue ideas or new opportunities merely for their own sake, but for their application to specific questions and issues that I feel are important.  I'm quite adept at following discussions on the developments of present trends into the future and at contributing to them on occasion if I feel so inclined, but I don't take that as seriously compared to investigating possibilities in the areas I'm interested in at present.

I can understand it when it's explained to me, but I would never come up with those explanations on my own.  If I had to solve the problems on my own, with no background information or secondary math education or anything, I'd be doing a hell of a lot of trial and error, and drawing pictures, trying to look for patterns.

Like for example if I had to figure the ball and bat problem on my own with no knowledge of algebra, I would probably go about it like:

Okay so the total is $1.10, and the bat is $1.00 more than the ball.  Okay so I know the bat is more expensive.  So $1.10 has to cover the total cost of the two items.  $1.10 divided by two is $0.60, so I know the bat is greater than $0.60, and the ball is less than $0.60.  But actually, the bat has to be greater than or equal to $1.00, because it's $1.00 more than the ball.  So...

* If the bat is $1.00, the ball would be $0.  Total $1.  So the bat has to be more expensive.
* If the bat is $1.01, the ball would be $0.01.  Total $1.02.  This is not going fast enough.  Let's skip ahead two cents.
* Okay so if the bat is $1.03, the ball would be $0.03, that's $1.06.  Almost there.  Need four more cents...divided by two, add to the $0.03, so that's...five cents each?  Let's try that.

For the lake one, I would probably need to draw a picture of each day of the lake to see how fast it got bigger.  Like I might pretend the whole lake was 100 squares, and I would say, okay on day one it's 1 square, on day two it's 2 squares, on day three it's 4 squares, and so on.  It would take me a while to realize that half the lake doubled makes the whole lake (like obviously I know this to be true, but I just wouldn't think about it), and I'd probably be confused because by my method I wouldn't have a day where exactly half the lake was full (I'd get to 32 squares, then 64).  I think I'd eventually figure it out if it were really important, but most likely I'd just be like ""This is stupid"" and go make a snack haha.

That's how my brain solves problems, if anyone's curious.  I can't help it; it would be easier if my Ti (or Ne maybe?) were stronger I guess, but it is what it is, and I usually end up getting the right answer in the end.  I like my shortcuts and formal problem-solving methods.

205974,"Sure, I'm happy to share what I know! :)

So ""supervision"" in general refers to the effect one function has on another.  For example, in ENFJs, our Fe supervises our Ni, our Ne supervises our Ti, and so on for all the functions.  What this means in terms of Ni might be that our Ni gets the sense that something is likely to happen, and our Fe says, ""That's not an ideal outcome.  I won't let that happen.""  Whereas an INFJ for instance, with unsupervised (or, more accurately, very weakly supervised) Ni is more likely to see the imagined scenario as inevitable.  For Ne supervising Ti, we're unwilling to definitively accept something as ""true"" or ""false"" simply because it makes sense - we have to mentally rule out other possibilities that present themselves to us.  So ENFJs are particularly prone to suspecting that nothing can be known for sure, for instance.

So to reiterate, each function in a type is supervised by one other function, and also supervises one other.  But which function supervisors which can differ depending on type.  For example, in INTPs, their Ni supervises their Fe and their Ti supervises their Ne - the opposite of ENFJs.  So when I talk to my INTP husband, I use my Ne to ""supervise"" his Ti, but his Ti supervises his Ne, so it's more of a constructive process than a destructive one - he doesn't feel criticized, but rather empowered, by my contributions.  ISTPs, on the other hand, do have Ne supervising Ti, but because Ne is their vulnerable function, it is very weak and mostly silent.  There is a danger in duals (in this case, ENFJ-ISTP) over-supervising each other's dominant function (the same would be the case with their Si and our Fe).  This is why semi-duals (e.g. ENFJ-INTP) do really well by talking out theories, intellectual disagreements, etc., whereas with duals it's better for each person to specialize in what they're good at and instead of debating, just letting the other person take the reins in our weak areas.  

A relationship of supervision has an issue, though.  This involves two types who have the same directionality of supervision.  In addition, one partner's dominant function supervises the second partner's dominant function - which means the first partner's dominant function is the second partner's vulnerable function.  For ENFJ-INTJ, this means that every time INTJ tries to Ni, ENFJ is right there with an Fe criticism.  Even if it's not explicit, just the *way the ENFJ is* reminds the INTJ of their vulnerable Fe, which is a sore spot and a source of insecurity and pain.  In turn, because Fe is as easy as breathing for the ENFJ, they will find themselves (no matter how hard they try) constantly critical of and baffled by INTJ's choices.  Things that seem obvious to ENFJ don't even seem to register to INTJ.  There is the danger of ENFJ feeling like INTJ is *purposefully* ignoring these areas or being spiteful or willfully obtuse (which, let's be real, is something ENFJs are prone to suspecting about people anyway lol).  They can keep trying to set up rules and agreements to avoid these problems, but there are almost an infinite number of ways in which Fe can supervise Ni, you can never fully account for them all, and even if you did, living in that environment would be stifling for both the INTJ (who feels restricted, judged, misunderstood, unvalued, useless) and the ENFJ (who feels like they have to hold their tongue, walk on eggshells, sacrifice their desires, hide their true feelings).

Compare this to a relationship of duality or semi-duality, where each partner's dominant function (easy as breathing) is the other's inferior (their deepest desire, their life purpose).  In cases of duality, they become kind of one symbiotic being, each covering the other partner's weak spots.  In cases of semi-duality, they train each other's weak spots, building each other up through trial by fire.

ENFJ x INFP is called contrary, and ENFJ x ISFP is called mirage.  I haven't studied the theory behind how these types interact as much, but a big advantage they have going for them is temperament.  ExxJ + IxxP naturally complement each other.  Where ExxJ is controlling, IxxP is adaptive.  Where ExxJ is tense and ready to go, IxxP is calm and lethargic.  ExxJs fill IxxPs with energy and motivation, and IxxPs bring peace and clarity to ExxJ lives.  Additionally, having their ignoring function as our dominant and vice versa allows for a lot of psychological exploration and depth.  In the right context, you can surface and analyze a lot of stuff that is usually suppressed.

Anecdotally, ENFJ x INFP is probably one of the best relationships for close friendship, but I think it lacks an element of romantic attraction or bonding.  ENFJ x ISFP is great for friendships and also like...romantic trysts?  You know.  Summer love, that kind of thing.  There's definitely a degree of magnetic attraction there, but it can be really hard to maintain long-term.  But either of these relationships can end up working in a life partner situation, often with very deep love and affection, but there will be something missing (Ti) that the ENFJ will have to find a different way to make up (perhaps through friends or work).

I think there are certainly some situations that could warrant 5 months of separation. That was never an implication, here, and to me it was never the issue, either. The issue was the lack of cooperation and commitment which is essential to a marriage that is actually going to be happy and healthy.

There is a huge difference between a couple who is committed but cooperate on a 5-month separation, and a couple that doesn't agree on a 5-month separation but one partner wants to plug ahead with it anyway despite the excessive amount of time apart and the stupid reason of a ""recently developed interest"" in going on a glorified hike.

Firstly, don't push yourself to open up.

If they don't understand, then I don't feel safe sharing my deep feelings with them. Sometimes I feel like they might be silently criticizing me too. After enough unfavorable experiences with someone, I close up again, throw on a mask when around them, and try to get over the fact they don't understand me (although I never seem to get over it). My sister doesn't understand me, so I regress to a more simple state around her (put on a mask) and try to do the thinking/feeling when I'm alone instead. I totally agree with the ""why others say and do the things they do."" So much would be solved! haha My dad doesn't display loving affection, but in a way--he does. He displays his love by buying and giving things to someone and after analyzing him, I intentionally get super happy and excited when he buys me (seemingly petty) things and hug him.

The way I cope with people misunderstanding me, is that I try again to explain myself, sometimes using an analogy or a similar comparison in their perspective--hoping that gets my message across.

I don't like the word ""normal."" Because what society wants, means that I'm not normal and normal is relative, biased, and a one-sided perspective. I try to look at things from a neutral, balanced perspective--giving fair chance to think about what everyone involved in a situation might be thinking.

Yes, I am ENFJ. I can relate to INFJs when I need to recharge, having overused my extraverted Feeling. Or when very very sad in general. Sometimes ENFP or even INFP when depressed. But rarely, don't worry.

I do not need anything in return when I do favors. In fact, I never intend to get anything back. This post is targeted at appreciating your own efforts yourself. And given the response, a lot of people could relate to my outcry. Love yourself first, so to speak.

Back to giving to much and not getting in return... There is something called social currency. Imagine giving a lot of this currency to people because you see they are in need (Fe). You yourself never think of asking/begging for this currency yourself. But neither the majority of people have the same skill as you do, meaning they would not see when you are in need.

409067,"Well, from someone with vulnerable Si, I can tell you how a *lack* of Si manifests:

* inability to take care of myself in a way that normal humans expect.  I've spent most of my life living surrounded by trash and dirt and broken things and find tasks like doing laundry or dishes almost impossible to keep up with on a regular basis.  On that note, I just realized that I have clothes in the washer that I forgot to transfer...two days ago...let me go take care of that...
* I am almost always physically uncomfortable in some way but have little to no idea what's causing it.  For example I may toss and turn in bed for 20 minutes, thinking that I just can't find a comfortable position, until I realize that I've actually had to pee the whole time.  This is probably the factor that bothers me most - I don't get a reprieve from discomfort, just from the ability to recognize and remove its source.
* I have no memory of most of the day-to-day events of my life.  Unless something was particularly impactful - and even sometimes when it was - it slips very quickly into the ether of my subconscious.  I've gotten used to incredulous friends: ""Don't you remember I told you...?""  No, no I do not. 
* This also manifests in me embarrassing myself by regularly saying the exact opposite of what I said yesterday.  It's fine with people who know me, but when you tell a new acquaintance ""I love this song so much!"" and they remind you that you hated it and made them turn it off the day before, it can get pretty uncomfortable.
* All of these examples are made up because even though I know I've done things like this before, it is nearly impossible for me to remember specific instances.
* Also whenever I get asked what I did yesterday/this morning, I freeze and feel like an idiot because I have no idea.
* Also because of this I always feel panicky and shitty about myself for ""not getting anything done"", even though I can see how much I've accomplished if I remember to write it down in a list.
* I trip, fall, bump into things, and hurt myself a lot.  Vulnerable Se users (you) get that too though.
* I have no idea where my car is on the road when I'm driving it.  It's very harrowing when there are e.g. narrow dividers.  And I'm terrible at parking.
* I have a LOT of power when doing tasks, but little to no stamina.  E.g. I can do something in ten minutes that takes most people 30, but I can *only* do it for ten minutes.  This is useful in many situations (taking a test, handling an emergency), but not in others (attending a lecture, sitting in a meeting, comforting a friend, watching/waiting for something to happen).  I get worn out very easily, but being an ExxJ I also have the constant need to be doing/achieving something.  Resting and relaxing can be very hard for me sometimes.
* It is very easy for persuasive people (including my own mind) to make me doubt myself.  I rarely feel certain about any belief once it's been directly questioned, and even my perception of reality is incredibly skewed by what's happening *right now in this moment*.  For instance, during a fight I almost always feel like I want to break up/leave the person I'm fighting with and/or kill myself because what's the point anyway, or if I have something unpleasant to get through it feels as though the rest of my life will always be that way.  Fortunately I am mature and experienced enough to be able to differentiate between feelings and reality, at least on an intellectual level, but viscerally it feels just as real to me as if it were literally true.
* Continuing from that, my bf and I have discussed solipsism a lot in reference to myself.  Again, the difference between an intellectual belief - other people are real and have thoughts and feelings, my hand cannot pass through that wall - and the visceral belief - nothing is real and it's all just generated by my mind.  Sometimes it feels like my grasp on reality is more tenuous than most people.  It's really easy for me to get into a mood of existential dread, ennui, fear of demons or Japanese water ghosts, apathy, dissociation, etc.  Fortunately it's also quite easy to get myself into a good or useful mood as well, but sometimes I forget that it's not as easy for other people, and this makes me resent them when they're acting in a way I don't want them to or that I don't see as healthy/productive.
* My interpersonal relationships are really turbulent because I am constantly changing my mind and maybe even my identity???

268343,"\#1. To be honest, the first thing that I thought of would be more clarification as to the situation that you described, but I figured that would be something outside of the situation itself. 

Otherwise, the first thing that would go through my mind would be a reassurance that everything is fine, and I could still fit in everything for the day, even a game of Monopoly if need be. I'd probably still have that nagging feeling that I should talk this over with her, but I'd be more likely to give her the benefit of the doubt as to who the other guy is (probably a friend or something, seeing as she invited me to play with them), but also be slightly worried as to what the wine is indicating. Besides, it's probably best to save that discussion for the road anyhow. I'd probably notice that she hasn't gotten ready for the trip, and maybe give her a little flak for that. And I'd probably want to join in the game with them.

\#2. I'll go with the first situation, but I could probably write about the second one as well if I wasn't so damn lazy.

I met this girl (we'll call her O) at a summer camp in middle school, and we instantly hit it off. Not in a romantic setting, but more of a personal, friendship kind of thing. Over the course of that week, O and her other friend (we'll call her B) became pretty close with me and a few other of my friends, but O was definitely close with me in particular. 

One day, one of my ""friends"" (he's not a friend anymore, if you could tell) aggressively hints towards O that I was romantically interested in her (Okay, so I was, but I'm awkward and not self-confident at all), and in my state of agitation and embarrassment, I explosively panic. I've never dealt with something even remotely similar to the experience, so I didn't know how to react whatsoever. Considering that B had asked me previously if I was attracted to her friend (and I made her swear up and down that she wouldn't tell her), and I sheepishly answered with a meek ""yeah, kinda,"" it made me extremely uncomfortable, and I quickly scurried off to my cabin to indulge in whatever privacy I could find.

Later at the mess hall, after one of the camp ""leaders"" managed to convince me to leave the cabin, I met up with O, and she was overly affectionate to me (again, in a friendly way), trying to cheer me up, and sincerely wanted to know why I reacted the way I did. So I somehow manage to muster up the courage to explain some of my other problems with relationships (hint: I had quite a few, even at 13), how I have no ""people skills"" whatsoever, and how it all accumulated into this giant ball of depression.

She replies by lifting up her sleeves, revealing the scars on her wrists.

I do the same.

It's oddly strange, because in that moment I knew that this was someone that I could really trust, someone that would just unconditionally love me as a person, and it was something I had never felt before. I had always felt like an outcast, like I didn't matter, and she showed me that I'm not the only person that feels this way; ""Understood"" doesn't even begin to describe it. She genuinely just wanted to be there for me, and I felt the exact same way for her. 1.5 years later, we're still great friends, even if we don't see each other too often.

\#3. Again, my first response outside of the situation was that of sheer confusion. So I'll try to make my way around the questions.

I'd probably first notice the man in the middle of the street, and ask why he's in the *middle* of the street, and why people are insulting him. Oh, and the duck costume seems a bit out of place, so that as well. And if ""new copy"" of Harry Potter implies a new book in the series, why J.K. Rowling wrote another one when the last one ended so perfectly. (and also why it's in an antique bookstore...) The children seem to be fine doing their own thing, as with the duck, so I probably wouldn't do anything to disturb that. My first thought would probably be of the smell of rain (I just love that smell...), but also that I should do something to help that homeless man out. Some kind of small gesture, like maybe getting him some pizza from that nearby pizzeria. I'd want to stand up for him against the crowd, but at the same time probably not do that, because of two reasons: 1) the pizza seems like a large enough gesture, and 2) I'm kinda afraid of large crowds...

\#4. 

I would probably read the note first, and see if it has any instructions as to the contents of the box, or even just a few more of the symbols or something. Either way, I would gather as much information as I could about the contents, and then probably try to see what I could do with it. If the levers and gears are fixed somehow, maybe see if I could rig it up to the box to try and open it, and if they aren't, add a step in before the previous instructions (fix the gears together in a ways that might open the box). In this situation, I would be driven by sheer curiosity, so I wouldn't be feeling much, just acting on a whim.

These were much more difficult to answer than I would have though, save for #2. I'm kind of anxious to see what kind of analysis you have for me.

We're not total shits.  We just can't hurt others emotionally, nor do we ever want to.  So it's kind of a mild depression about about 'cognitive dissonance' with how humans are.

In theory the relationship in MBTI is a wierd one. They both have all opposing functions, and in the complete opposite order. No matter what you're going to be thinking in a complete opposite manner.

Our relationship was bumpy to start. He had some wierd opinions and I was a bitter arguer. I just wouldn't appeal to his Fe (this is all in retrospect). I was incredibly frank sometimes and I doubt he appreciated it.

He was also incredibly popular. He knew everyone. Like, walking down the hall, he knew every stranger. I was actually incredibly jealous. Then again, I had much better grades and I picked up skills a bit faster than him, and he later admitted he was jealous of me. This jealousy eventually lead to a small split.

Once he left my college program, however, suddenly our tension was gone. Ironically it was when I typed hm personally that our friendship became really strong. It was a bonding moment for us (mostly for him). We still talk on a regular basis, we're good friends.

It's definitely about an unstoppable force meeting... Another unstoppable force. One thing I did was I just started listening to him. He's bi and had a lot of opinions on LGBTQ community. I've learned a lot from him. I'm sure he's learned a lot from me too. Hopefully.

1259558," I've said this before, so for those that have seen this before, I apologize for repeating myself. The MBTI is only useful as a self-reflection on what you are cognitively good at. Employers shouldn't use it, friends should only use it for a laugh, and the internet needs to chill about it. Myers and Briggs may have tried to show careers that each type generally gravitates to, but that's really only so useful. Sure, your type may have the cognitive functions to be able to excel at the job. However, there are a lot more factors that go into job performance than cognitive functions, like technical knowledge or ability. 
 As for the 16 types, Jung had less, and that's still useful. Remember, MBTI is ONLY about cognitive functions. Just like job performance, there are many factors that contribute to personality. The cognitive functions are important when it comes to bare bones, but you don't build the framework and then call it complete.                                                                                      
 Making relationship decisions based upon cognitive functions is also unwise. Once again, there are many factors that go into building relationships, and how you process information is just a small part of that. I hope most of us realize that the MBTI doesn't explain everything about someone's personality. It might be a useful tool, but it shouldn't be the only tool in the toolbox.
 As for why I think the MBTI is useful over Jung's work: because it allows me to understand how I make decisions based upon the info I've gotten from the cognitive functions. Jung's work didn't really allow for functions for judging, only taking in information. Thus, the MBTI has a bit more for me to understand myself. And that's all I use it for.",ENFP,290,1767,mbti

The Ne and Ni are similar enough to share similar thoughts/outlooks/experiences but different enough to be interesting.

The reason why ENFPs tend to be drawn to INTJs in particular is because they share the same middle two functions (Te and Fi), which are just swapped over. This makes it very easy to understand each other. The same is true, I think, of ENTPs and INFJs, who share Fe and Ti.

In summary, the two types can very easily relate to each other due to their similarities (both have dominant intuition and same judging functions) but approach things in slightly contrasting ways (Using Ni or Ne) and prefer to focus on slightly different aspects of things (Te and Fi are in different positions within their function orders).

Edit - One further point: I think the main thing really is the dominant intuition. All my favourite people are INTJs, ENFPs, ENTPs or INFJs. We love the joys of the mind, ENFPs and ENTPs in an crazy and enthusiastic way and INTJs and INFJs in a calm and reserved way.",ENFP,196,1218,ENFP

I told him without him doing anything to show he loves or cares for me we are just flatmates who have sex not a couple. Nothing changed. We broke up. I am soooo much happier without him and the next person I dated was amazing at showing me they cared through making time to see me and thoughtful gestures. 

I personally think your partner should make an effort on your birthday. Plan a date. Have a thoughtful gift. Do things to make you feel loved like give a massage or bring you a cup of tea. Even if it's not on the actual day but another day close to it that they can come see you. My ex forgot my birthday and planned nothing. I was very hurt by this.

I would say have the talk like I did. Tell him what you need to be happy and feel cared for and loved. Give specific examples. Tell him how important it is. But unlike me who had this convo more than once (""hey remember how you said you'd make an effort well nothing has changed and I'm still unhappy..."") I think once is enough. If he doesn't make an effort to show he cares the first time, or if his idea of effort is still not enough to make you happy, then break up.

Your family saying you can do better is something you should listen to. They aren't caught up in feelings and just see that you aren't as happy as they think you deserve to be.

At the end of the dinner, he asked me if I was dating anyone. I gave him a nothing answer, and he said, ""I've been crazy about you for years."" I was shocked in a pleasant way.

Starting on the left, we can rule out all F types due to the dominant 8. It's extremely rare for a F type to be 8s. We can go even further, because enneagram 8 is relatively concentrated around ExTx types, with ExTJs being the most likely.

Moving on to ennagram 7, which is most commonly found in ExxPs, and secondarily in ExTJs. Finally enneagram 3 is most common in ENTJs followed by ESTPs. It is thus very likely that the person on the left is either an ENTJ or ESTP.

Let's go to the right person. Enneagram 5 as dominant indicates that the person is an introvert, most likely an IxTx. 9w1 is also very common among introverts, but with the scales slightly tipped towards the ISxx.

But precisely where do you find fault in my statements? Do you have information or evidence or anecdotes to contradict it? Or do you just dislike it?   


Also do you agree with the main point here that Te doms tend to be *more* focused on their goal itself? Or do you believe Fe doesn't affect their goal focus at times? If so why? 


(I know that each individual is different so Fe doesn't mean EVERY EXFJ isn't as narrowed in on objectives and goals (because I can think of one who sorta is), but I am of the opinion that on average, particularly in comparison to EXTJs, they'll be a little less narrowed in on goals and objectives)  


EDIT: Also if you think I'm bashing Fe doms. I am not. Or at least that is not the intention. We (Fe doms and Te doms) simply think differently. We have a similar outlook on life, but care about different things. We have different strengths, different weaknesses and different distractions. (weaknesses get further differentiated when you add that N and S variable into the equation). EXTJs aren't perfect goal machines, we have functionally attributed distractions too. The thing is. By comparison being less focused on persons themselves gives us a bit more focus on goals, and makes us less likely to alternate them, or pause to accommodate others   


Metaphorically. EXXJs are running a marathon. Both want to reach the finish line. EXTJs want to reach the finish line first, ideally in record time. An EXFJ wants to enjoy the run and ensure that people have (most times) a good time.

680614,"Junior year is was in prom court, which sucked for my date, and senior year, I kind of just went to prom with a person I sort of knew, did the prom things, and raged at the after party our bus had. The latter prom was the more fun one. 

I would go because it's cheesy high school fun and it's something you can remember with people, or at least get a few stories out of. Go to prom, do the things, talk to people you kind of know and go to an after party and drink like any other alcohol sensitive high schooler. Prom isn't one high school event. It's an entire rite of passage that goes from asking the girl, to the prom pics before to the event, then to the after party. It may sound tedious, I know, but the entire experience is a good time.

If you still need a reason, go for the social experience. High school is irrelevant in college, but you may go to more events like prom (black tie) in the future. Go to learn how to socialize with people in a formal setting. Go to get experienced with going on a formal date. Be suave, be fancy, pretend to be James Bond or something.

They made me look at the situation as if these perceptions were delusion, and then made me seriously consider if my life really was THAT hopeless. That put me in some emotional shock where I was obsessively denying my life could suck that bad.

3. Yes, SJs do tend to be drawn to religion for reasons of community, tradition, and ritual. But Ni actually is all about finding a big picture -- in my experience Ni can lead to skepticism but it can also lead to mysticism and much deeper faith (again, I think you get this in Mayim Bailik's video -- she talks about a belief in God as the underlying force and reason for everything... a very Ni way of thinking).

My paragraph on mental illness will be brief: I have Asperger's and honestly I just deal with it.

Being able to recede is incredibly important for Fi development and it's a combination of my need for lower stimuli and a conscious decision to do so when I isolate myself. I need time **for me** and access my support system when **I** need it. I get really pissy when someone tells me to access my resources as it removes the modicum of agency I possess.

9950,"I have dated two INTPs, one for two years and one for a month. Both ending on not being able to commit to long distance relationships.

I loved them both to bits. I could go on about them forever, however I will just go over some quick pros and cons of both relationships due to time limits for me right now.

Pros:

They were completely different in personality than myself. This offers so many conversation topics that are new to each other, we would always have something to talk about.

They are not too emotional. Dealing with feelings with them was both easy and efficient. They both got super emotional about some things including fandoms and whatever book they were reading at the time. But for the most part, it was emotional drama free.

They don't need constant attention. We could go a week without talking and be absolutely fine without any damage done. They can entertain themselves. On this note, I would always be the one to initiate anything, so if we did go a week without talking, it would be due to me.

I respected their opinion higher than my own ~70% of the time. I love being right, but I'm not stubborn and I'm always open to disagreements if they lead to a better decision. So in this, I found that INTPs would always be better at using logic than myself. So in any conversation where things get theoretical, my partner would normally take over and explain what was in her head. And this was probably one of the best traits for me with INTPs, they are smart but not assholes about it.

I really liked their introverted traits. This may sound bad, but I liked the fact they were both shut ins, and didn't have many friends. It meant that I could show them new things and put them in new situations, this meant more interesting dates/outings. I would invite them both into my already made friend circle which me being an ENTJ, I hand picked myself, and it meant they made new friends. I like having a small close group of best friends and INTPs just integrate with it so well.

I had control in somethings, and they had control in others. I'm sometimes a control freak, and both the INTPs I've been with liked to be controlled in some ways. So in everyday decision making or planning, I would naturally and instinctively just take charge. It was easier this way since both INTPs would have to stop and think about small decisions, they are slow sometimes, so I would just decide for them and they didn't mind at all. However, in larger decisions that must be made, they would have the control, they would (after some encouragement) always take on decisions that takes time to make. Basically the point is, I ran the day to day tasks and my partner would run the larger scale tasks.

Cons

Although the limited emotions is a blessing, it can also be a curse. One of my INTPs would never compliment me, which hurt because I need my ego stroked ever so often lmao. But somehow it made me want to do better and impress her more. I like the chase. We are both robots but I need to be appreciated ever so often, and for INTPs, this doesn't come naturally.

They would over think everything. Remember how I said there isn't emotional drama. Well very very rarely, there is. (Might be inconsistencies in what I'm saying, will respond to questions if any). But my INTPs both liked to over analyse things I said and to my view; take them out of context or twist the words. I live in the moment, so unfortunately I say stupid things that I regret later about. For me, words can be taken back, people can change. But for my INTPs, words show what people are feeling and thus, if I said something mean, they will hold onto it for a while and think over it. To deal with this, I had to start thinking about what words I use around them a lot more. I needed to send clear messages, no beating around the bush. It was communication I was comfortable with, so problems rarely did arise like this.

The pros outweigh the cons 100 to 1

Honestly, in both relationships, everything was golden. I felt like both relationships just clicked naturally and we complimented each other well.

126250,"&gt;It seems to me emotion is one of the most important variables in our decision making. A truly rational cost/benefit analysis would have to include emotion variables.

Agree completely.  However, there's a difference between taking emotion into account and letting it be the driving force in the decision making process.  We thinkers naturally minimize our own emotions and are less attuned to those of others.  As a result, it can be tempting to ignore emotion completely.  This shortcut may not be an ideal process, but it leads to *generally* good results in impersonal decision making.  Of course, problems may arise when we attempt to apply it to personal or emotionally-charged matters.

**edit:** The majority of our decision-making process is subconscious, so thinkers and feelers alike are at the mercy of their emotions.  The theory above deals solely with *conscious* decision making.

▷N-Mom loves shoving/holding my head/face down for some reason. She shoved me down the floor. She shoved me down a bathtub full of water. She shoved me down my plate while eating. She shoved me down a wooden desk. She'd pull me up by the hair then shove me down again and again and would only stop when a physical injury/sign starts to show on my face. She then quickly soothes me by the hair and applies concealer/make-up on my face.

▷Badmouthing me to everyone they know and reversing the stories. ""Warning"" others to stay away from me.

▷My N-Dad thrives on my fear: he came at me with a pair of surgical scissors. I've never screamed and sobbed for help so desperately in my life. He also doesn't stop until I'm officially writhing/motionless on the floor: he threw thick, heavy books on my freaking chest. He'd drag me back and forth and choke me like I was some rag doll until I'm just lying there, helpless.

▷Forcing me to watch them have sex. Forcing me to hear them have sex. Then hurting me for ""not respecting their privacy"". This experience caused me major trauma, honestly.

It's not your fault that your N-Parents are projecting whatever unfulfilled needs/dreams/other things they had onto you. And it's definitely not your fault when they can't cope with the fact that you don't want to be another them: you just want to be YOU.

I still appreciate and respect them as individuals who have done both good and bad but unfortunately, as parents, I don't ""love"" them. They don't feel ""important"" to me. I guess something just shut down within me and accepted that you can't change nor save people when they really don't want to be saved. And it's okay to save yourself first, you know.

It did help, and I'm more okay with the things that were bothering me, but it never really leaves you.  You always will know how you thought then, and a part of you always holds those beliefs.

You are just anxious. The same kind of anxiety every single person feels when putting ourselves ""out there"" awaiting some type of ""judgment"" on our self-worth. 

Ti-users suppresses the physical sensation of emotions, to the point that we feel ""cold"" and ""emotionless"" inside. This is an illusion however, bc all humans have feelings. Ours tend to get routed into the logic matrix and cause havoc. In other words--frantic, cyclical, over-analyzing thoughts.

Solution? Recognize it *to be* anxiety. Relax into it. Be anxious! It's normal, don't fight it or try to rationalize your feelings away. Don't try to soothe yourself using her level of interest: down that road lies more anxiety and potential self-esteem hit if she doesn't. Instead, work to explore why you are so anxious about dating. 

Consider the following: It's not a judgment on you if she doesn't want a second date. It just mean that you don't fit in her vision of her own future, for whatever reason. It's not personal. How can it be, after ONE DATE? Don't treat any date as though you are ""auditioning"" for her approval. It's a mutual get-to-know, a mutual evaluation. A ""no"" ought to simply mean, *Ok, onto the next*. So why do you feel anxiety, and  what is triggering the insecurity behind this anxiety? Work on that instead. Doing so will eventually result in you being more relaxed on dates, hence better dates, hence better prospects for 2nd dates, etc. ",ENTP,247,1472,entp

EDIT: ~~What are some things you've learned?~~ 

I didn't see the rest of your post! I'll respond to that now:

    My main obstacle that I haven't been able to personally overcome is daily diligence type things - like getting my car tags renewed, setting doctor's appointments, etc. I continually put them off until the last minute/after the last minute and endure the ensuing fines/fees.

I can discuss that!

Yeah, I'm similar, but have really learned how to work past that.


I first had to come to an intellectual understanding about why I left things last-minute.
--And I still do, believe me! But now I do it much less frequently.

Long story short: I realized that I have big plans, and that there are a lot of small things that get in the way of making serious progress. Furthermore, those small things add up quick, and then you have some big problems that really take some time to fix.

What helps me is that I realize that while they do suck, that doesn't make them any *less* of a priority. You know what I mean--life piles up inconveniences fast, and problems always come at the most convenient times.

The trick is to change how your mind value these tasks. You could see them as things that get in the way of your plan, or you can think of them as easy to take care of tasks that, once solved, allow you to make serious progress  in your bigger plans.

Whenever something of this nature comes up, I immediately tell Siri to add a reminder. More often than not, it doesn't take as much time as we like to think to deal with these problems.

It's just that they're so *mundane!* That's why we hate doing them. However, once you get used to dealing with them, they'll seem less like inconveniences, and more like priorities.

this is not how scientific knowledge works. Science is rarely for sure certain 100%, this is unreal expectation when judging scientific theories.

Moreover, the theory itself doesn't include or build upon what we know about brains, doesn't even explain why it doesn't go back to that knowledge.

I'd argue that bullshitting is our temptation, not our identity. We are able to think on our feet, which means that in a pinch we can sound really smart.

It's a level of sensitivity to the environment. Many people who start out introverted as babies, balance out later in life, many extreme extroverted children quieten, some people fluctuate. With this definition, there is ambiversion and that is a category where 60% of people roughly fall. 

Jungian Extroversion is it's own concept, and is defined by your orientation towards the external world; do you focus on your interaction with the object, or do you focus on the interaction with your own thoughts and feelings towards the object?

Yeah, but I think that the underlying issue of the discrimination, you discriminate against people not because they individually were rude to you or your staff, you discriminate them based on your prejudice or beliefs.

For example in my glorious motherland, they're pushing a law that a pharmacist can deny processing your receipt from GP for hormonal contraception because of their religious beliefs. Their job is not more complicated then selling cakes, processing medical receipts. Should they be able to exempt themselves on religious grounds, or should they be forced to go against their religious beliefs and sell you those drugs?

But in all honesty you knew you would get me interested with that reading between the lines puzzle bullshit. I know you are manipulating a response. Its okay I want to see where it goes. However I did not read back over any of your other comments, Im sorry im kinda being a dick. If this pisses you off we can continue playing games tomorrow.

&amp;nbsp; 

You can have my judgement:

* I think you are deeply insecure. Thats okay but you got work on it. I am sure you feel superior to others. Thats not because you actually are, its because you are deeply insecure and have to rely on that feeling to not completely collapse. You are currently whining on the internet, talking to a complete stranger (a stoner) lying on his couch crafting a reddit comment at 2.33 am. Come on. 

That does not mean you dont have talents and strengths other dont have. And in this world, where everyone has to market themselves having a unique strength and ten weaknesses can be more valuable than being the average joe. It all depends on the marketing.

&amp;nbsp;

* You probably want me be critical of society and the way things are going. I will not be. I have very complex opinions that are hard to pinpoints and I havent made my mind up on many issues that I see simply because there isnt an easy solution especially if we were to actually implement them in the real world. Whilst I am willing to have discourse on it, I wont be killing my fingers. Ill just talk to people in the real world.

* I think you are being a major dickhead to the people around you, and I think you dont realize. Are you nice to them? They care about what you say to them. People will not hangout with a depressed arrogant cynic. Its just not fun, and at the end of the day they are exhausted too and cant be arsed to have fucked up conversations. I think you are a lone because of this and I think you started despising people, looking down on them, pretending they are worse than they actually are. Instead of making an effort to have nice friendly connections. Deepness comes with time, mutual respect and trust. People dont just open up just because someone talks about their life and how everyone else sucks. A really really good advice is: call your mom. I dont know if this is actually possible, and I have issues with my parents too but I still called my mom the other day and even though we ended up fighting over the phone the minutes before that and the end of the call were nice. Mothers are grounding and can give you the perspective and advice you tried very hard your whole puberty to not listen to. (This can obviously be extended to other family members/friends however applicable)

* I bet you care majorly what other people think of you. Thats a really tough one I sometimes struggle with myself, especially if Im not doing too well. All I  can say is: They will never know you, how you think and percieve the world, that your strengths and weakness are just different, which pathes you followed and what experiences you made. They have only their limited experiences to judge you upon. How can their opinion of you be more important or accurate than your own. Talk to the people you have known for the longest period of time and that know you the best. What do they think of you? How would you act around them. How did you behave and think years back in time, when you were less mature but maybe emotionally better off? Dont compare yourself to others, compare yourself to yourself.

I hate conflict. I avoid confronting others for as long as I can. Sometimes I can manage to escape a situation without ever confronting someone. 

I'm passive-aggressive because it's hard for me to make a persuasive argument that gives me the greatest chance of being right. I end up letting my feelings take over which leads to me rambling or ranting. Sometimes I fantasize that if I were a T, it would make this whole conflict resolution thing a lot easier. 

I don't want my relationship with that person to go sour if I confront them about an issue I have with them. I am afraid they will retaliate. I am afraid of being called a hypocrite. I am afraid that they will see every single hole in my argument and crush me into tiny broken pieces. I am afraid we won't be friends anymore. I am afraid they will take it personally.

1005739,"Like others here have said, I displayed a lot of traits that are characteristic of my type from an early age. I'm an ESFJ, and I've always been very people-oriented, even as a kid. As a toddler, I used to love when my parents had company over and would actually sit on the stairs and cry when they left. I actually still have my diaries that I kept when I was in elementary school and they're full of lists of the people I considered friends in my class and the people I didn't like for whatever reason (usually because they were mean to me). I cared a lot about what my classmates thought of me, as well as the adults in my life too. I was always seeking approval from my teachers, and was usually teacher's pet as a result. When I misbehaved and was reprimanded by a teacher, they never had to punish me because I would feel like the biggest shit in the world and would start crying on my own. Based on that, I think MBTI is largely genetic, but my ESFJ mom definitely played a role in my development as an ESFJ as well. If I did something she deemed socially inappropriate, I would get a stern talking-to afterwards, and she was always telling me to think about others before thinking of myself. ",ESFJ,227,1199,mbti

MBTI is merely an observation. So yes the types are just a tendency towards a certain pair of functions. But just like you can't know anything about someone's workout technique or how much cardio/strength they have only by looking at if they are a bodybuilder/sprinter, you can't know anything about how smart or how creative etc someone is based on their personality type. It's complicated. In other words MBTI doesn't give enough information to know anything about the details of a person, just like knowing that someone is a weight lifter doesn't tell you anything about the details of their gym routine or their progress.

So to bring that together... spending time saying what brain function you are using to do something, for example ""I am using Ni to get information"" is about as pointless as saying ""when I lift things I use my arms."" Studying MBTI is like studying a tool. Won't make you any better with the tool. 

Granted, the difference with the tools in the theory of MBTI are not as obvious as say an arm or a leg. But it's the same idea. People see the functions and don't really get the gist of it, because I'll be honest it's hard to explain the tools in MBTI. Jung wrote about 50 or 100 pages to do so.

Also, prohibiting another human from being able to exercise their autonomy must be wrong because it violates their capacity to abide by these maxims (whatever they are).

The person who introduced me to MBTI is an ESFJ too but he almost never posts in online forums now. He's too busy helping others in med school and running half-marathons.

Intuitive descriptions sound interesting compared to sensor ones so people who honestly are sensors pick that. Either sensors are really just not interested in internet communities or people just don't like identifying as such.

There are also bias of test questions and a lot of people take the actual mbti online tests seriously and don't type based on functions. I think because a lot of people find the identity part cool but the theory part is either too much information to digest, dismissed because of some value judgement, or just aren't truly interested in theory. It doesn't help that a lot of stuff online is.. contradictory. The value judgement is usually based around scientific merit but I don't think theory necessarily needs that to study to be interesting. But for many people because they judge it to for some reason to not hold validity they just take a test and talk to others for a sense of community or identity.

Also, I think Fe/fi dom/aux people take a lot of interest in either community or identity which is why their subreddits are so populated. The outliers are INTP and INTJ. I have no explanation for INTP and INTJ but I think that is because the introverts like online communities in general more.

I think really people who would take interest in these places would more likely be introverts and that is highly reflected in these results.  I think the ""mastermind"" description is part of why INTJ is so favored as reddit has a highly male population and likes to see itself as rational and  logical.

Words like ""creative, fascinating, and interesting"" were used for intuitives whereas words like ""conventional, literal, and by-the-book"" were used for sensors. With criteria like that, who wouldn't want to be a intuitive? I tested as ENFJ whereas I've been an ESFJ on every other test. A lot of people who should have been ISFJs were typed as INFJs. I couldn't find a single ESFJ, but there were plenty of people who got ENFJ as their type. Since ESFJs are much more common than ENFJs, I find this to be telling.

297265,"I don't know where all this stereotype of INTJs being an arrogant prick claiming to know-it-all and thinking everyone else is an idiot came from, cognitive function wise it would make much more sense for the INTP to be like that, and I quote from this beautiful article http://www.personalityhacker.com/intp-vs-intj/

&gt;Even when we’ve graduated beyond our insecurities, the fact that they existed at some point influences our early strategies for navigating the world.
It’s been said by some that both INTPs and INTJs can come across arrogant, which I think is a surface understanding of what’s going on with both types (even when they’re at their “I’m going to strangle you now” worst).
As mentioned before, an INTP is constantly scanning for the cleanest data possible because they can’t actually show proof for their conclusions. Accuracy is by definition a subjective criteria: “it makes sense to me.”
Like Authenticity users (as mentioned in the INFP vs INFJ article), if the audience isn’t getting it an INTP can become (in order) confused, frustrated and ultimately cynical. There is always some insecurity about others invalidating their arguments and conclusions, but instead of staying in the realm of hurt (as an INFP may), the easiest solution is to just assume everyone else is an idiot.
Harboring insecurities is just another way for indicating immaturity, and an immature INTP will show up as The Authority On All Subjects, assuming they are right and you are wrong. When an INTP is accused of arrogance, it’s generally because they have a growing pathology toward being right at all times.
Conversely, the more mature an INTP becomes, the more they’re delighted at being proven wrong. That’s the outer world helping them cleanse data they may have grown attached to / become biased toward!
This is generally done through the development of their Co-Pilot process of Exploration, a function that opens frames and actively looks for more information to plug into existing frameworks.

&gt;For an INTJ, there is little to no insecurity about being right. If you don’t agree with them they might debate with you about it, but they understand that perception defines reality and you may just be seeing things fundamentally differently.
Ultimately, the proof is in Effectiveness, and you’ll see how wrong you are when the outer world plays it all out.
The insecurity an INTJ faces is more of a well guarded secret. INTJs are surprisingly sensitive, and as mentioned in our article about the INTJ personality type, anyone they let in can do real damage.
The insecurity lies in just how amazingly vulnerable they are to others. For a hardcore Thinker, it’s incredibly disconcerting for the INTJ to realize they are wired to be sensitive without the benefit of commensurate (natural) emotional intelligence.
The arrogant front an INTJ puts up isn’t to deflect being proven wrong, it’s to deflect against the hurt and pain another person potentially represents. It’s a true wall, an impenetrable domain around the inner sanctum that you may or may not ever be invited into.
The more insecure and immature the INTJ is, the thicker and more impenetrable the wall.
Conversely, the more mature an INTJ the more they understand that their personal happiness is directly linked to their willingness to be vulnerable. They may still be protective, but they don’t close themselves off universally. The INTJ builds healthy boundaries which allow special people in, who are the lucky recipients of their extraordinary understanding.
If you’re trying to determine your type between INTP and INTJ ask yourself: are you more put-off by being wrong, or by being vulnerable?

&gt;Obsessive Focus on External Data  
&gt;Their attempts to control the details in their environment are often expressed in such activities as feverishly cleaning the house, moving furniture, and organizing records and other materials. They may show an adamant concern about minute details and an unrelenting effort to control everything in their immediate vicinity.  
&gt;""When I’m using power tools that can cause injury, I will spend an inordinate amount of energy making sure that I’m not going to inadvertently hurt myself when I turn the thing on. I will triple-check to make sure my fingers are out of the way, etc.""  
&gt;“I’m more likely to have accidents,” said an INTJ.“I’m robotic, forget things, say things backwards; I’m obsessed with a thought and can’t get it out of my mind. I try to control situations and people and engage in strange behavior, like checking on things,” said an INTJ woman. And another INTJ woman said,“I can become obsessed by detail. I’m less able to function and make decisions—sort of paralyzed.”  
&gt;Overindulgence in Sensual Pleasures  
&gt;“I have to get away from reality. I do too much of something— one thing. I eat more or stop eating; I shop for useless things.” Another said,“I eat too much, spend too much, watch TV or read excessively to escape. I’m late for everything.” An INTJ said her pattern is to overeat, feel guilty about it, wake up in the night and feel worse, get too little sleep, causing her to feel more vulnerable, and then eat more.  
&gt;Adversarial Attitude Toward the Outer World  
&gt;“I start tripping over things and feel out of control in the external world. I feel like I’m under a dark cloud. I get hung up on some false fact and distort it. I get stressed out about time—too many things and not enough time. I attack others with words and then feel guilty.”An INFJ described herself as “shutting down, communicating very little. I misplace things, especially keys and watches. I’m very harsh, critical, not diplomatic. I lose my temper, obsess about details, organize, reorganize, yet nothing gets done.”

1416657,"This sounds like an ESFP.....I recommend reading the descriptions of Se, Fi and Te functions; for the fact of some online descriptions being written pretty much shitty and a bore for an extraverted sensor to read, I attach my own description of what it feels like to be an ESFP.

Obviously everyone uses Se in some basic way, I mean you do need your senses to survive.
But being a Se-dom is interesting because you don't take in stuff that's going around you just to survive, you take it in because it stimulates you. This is probably why Se-doms usually have a very energetic presence. We kind of absorb so much of our environment and react to it so much that the environment has to absorb us in return. It's the law of action and reaction. You will find that Se-doms are hard to ignore, you may find them great or you may find them annoying, but rarely will you find yourself not having an opinion about a Se-dom that you interacted with. When they enter a room, 3 minutes later they have absorbed so much of that room that they feel like the room and everything inside that room is inside them.
The sounds, colors, objects and people around me literally stimulate my mind just by being there. When I watch a TV show of a HQ production, I can literally feel how certain strong color tones stimulate me and make me energized, and I'm stimulated by aesthetics in the same way, by pleasant shapes, beautiful facial features, colors of eyes, hair colors, and also by fragrances. A mild fragrance can cause several very vivid flashbacks, this is how strongly we are stimulated by the senses.
This is one of the things that makes an ESFP look shallow, ""Oh girl look at those shoes!!!"", what an observer doesn't know that our mind is literally getting high on energy as it's being stimulated by the color and shape of that shoe, kind of like getting high on drugs I guess, but without drugs, that's why Se-doms are so hyped.

Introverted feeling (Fi) as a second most dominant function makes you more aware and pay more attention to your own feelings than to feelings of other people, which is why Fe types can often see Fi types as egotistical, but the thing is that Fi has their own individual idea of morality. Even though they are able to empathize with others and they often do, Fi types don't feel comfortable conforming to group values for the sake of it because it makes them feel like they're not being true to themselves and their beliefs; they feel like they have to act on their own feelings, beliefs and convictions in order to feel balanced, as their emotions stem from their own personal idea of right and wrong, that doesn't have to align with the group ideals; on the contrary, Fe types will usually give priority to the needs of the group instead of acting in accordance with their own emotional needs - they feel like they are doing the right thing by serving the ideals of a group or society, and that everyone should do so.

Te as a tertiary function makes an ESFP a pretty logical type; even though they don't like theories for the sake of them, their practicality comes from the external logic function (Te) that is a very adaptable kind of logic; it looks for faulty reasoning in concepts and theories and strives to make objective and applicable conclusions.

ESFPs are naturally good with people and like to be around them. They enjoy being the center of attention, as interacting and meeting new people energizes them. They also love to learn by interaction. They usually find theories boring, especially if they can't find a way to apply them in real life.",ESFP,643,3579,mbti

With sensing daydreams, I find myself reliving or simulating experiences, without giving those experiences too much thought or analysis. Like, imagining myself flying around, having some kind of super power, embracing a lover, something like that. It's all about imagining how it'd feel, or what the experience would be like. ""Feeling the wind whip against my skin as I jet through the air, watching the light glow and build around my hands right before I shoot laser beams out of them""

When on my meds, the daydreams take on less of a ""how would it feel"" aspect, and more of a ""what would it cause"". If I imagine myself having super powers, it's no longer ""Blowing shit up by shooting lasers out of my hands feels awesome"", but rather it's ""What would I do with these powers? Would using them outright be the wisest move? How would people react when they saw I had them? What kinds of things could I potentially do, if I had these powers? Could I shoot lasers out of my hands to power some kind of generator, giving the world free energy?""

Your criticism about grammticality is merited by itself. But it became no longer credible, like the other commenters responses, when you more or less, provided me with ad hominems. That my post is as difficult as it is to read, because of my pretention.

I enjoy politics immensely, and I love learning about new concepts and watching interviews of highly intelligent individuals on different viewpoints (i.e. Neil DeGrasse Tyson on Astrophysics or Richard Dawkins on non-religiousness, etc.). I have an incredible difficulty/dislike at looking to the future when it comes to my own life. I love seeing current events develop and theory-crafting how it might affect unrealistic future events.

69739,"&gt;Si types are “honest” in the sense that they find it difficult to have ulterior motives. If an Si type wants something, they will try to be straightforward about it and expect others to do the same. To them, **“the world is as it seems”**, because **humans AREN’T actually all that complicated**. 
Being an Si type means you are forcibly grounded in reality and no amount of fanciful thinking can sway you. It means for the most part, you believe that what you see is what you get and there is, in fact, **NOT an underlying, mystical “meaning”** to everything.

Not sure what to say about it at the moment, but I feel like I must point out this part sounds a lot more similar to Lenore Thomson's description of Se rather than Si:

&gt;Extraverted Sensation (Se) makes sense of the world by attending to what exists concretely here and now, and trusting your instincts. As an epistemological perspective, Se leads you to **believe only in what you can see and experience concretely, and to trust your immediate**, gut-level responses to it. **If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, then it’s a duck**. Whatever a sign means is obvious and inescapable; **if a sign’s meaning is not obvious, then it’s meaningless**. Whatever is physical, immediate, gut-level cannot be faked and must be right. 

Keep in mind she kept a more MBTI based approach rather than socionics so her descriptions tend to emphasize the fact that Fi and Te, Si with Ne etc. would be total opposites. This means that while she talked a lot about mysticism and underlying realities in Ni, she said that the total opposite would be Se as you see where the world is ""as it is"".

I am very withdrawn from people. It's not that I'm afraid of talking to them, I will talk to them, but I can be pretty spiteful about it.

I've had depression for like a decade now. Most of the time it's been in remission but the drugs I used to be on kind of dulled me out so I wasn't very social, leading me to think I am an introvert... I don't know. I still don't really know.

I mostly just put up a blockade for emotions. I think INFP is more keen on letting those emotions pour out, but I don't want much to do with them because once I start down the ""why me"" path it ends up in contemplating suicide...and I can't really do that. So I distract myself all day long with all types of media, and when I have to tear myself away for a while, the depression hits like a strong gust of wind.

So their relative effect becomes magnified while your day-to-day ambient experience becomes ignored. People will be numb to the big picture of their life and overly sensitive to the small novelties. They will even unknowingly look for and cherry-pick those events from their past that reinforce what their ego consciously wants them to be. I think it's generally extremely hard to have any specific sense of how you were in the past because it gets lost in the annals of your mind, making it very hard to retrieve in a complete and clear way that can be useful for accurate self-assessment. 

Even worse, if you decide looking into your past is riddled with bias, you then realize that the very act of attempting to reflect on ""What am I thinking right now?"" is just as faulty because attempting to be aware of your thoughts quickly renders them inauthentic. You start to shape even your present mental state into the image of your conscious ego. It's like observing a quantum system; you know there's some deterministic dynamics behind it all, but any attempt to probe it irrevocably contaminates the state. All you can do is poke at it every once in a while, record the reaction, wait for it to settle, and repeat; then you can hope that the meticulously recorded pattern of responses will tell you something about what's really going on.

I actually do wonder if a decent way to type people is to be forced, at random intervals, to interrupt what they're doing and to write down what they're thinking at that moment. It's still contaminated by the act of self-reflection, but maybe there's something useful you can glean from it. It also does help to get feedback from people who are around you... those who know you kind of well but not too well i.e. enough to have a sense of you, but not enough to know of the exceptions to your usual self.

A situation where they don't feel any remorse for the act I would anonymously turn them in, if they did show some remorse and empathy I would help them through the situation and suggest they turn themselves in.

Linguistic information makes up a significant share of the overall information we (as adults) are exposed to on a daily basis.

Most of the 16personalities stuff is in squares and shapes like that. I'm just making the individual characters, in case you didn't know.

So, what I've got for ISTJ right now is an inspector, which I really want to change. I kind of associate ISTJs with being highly meticulous and thorough, which I thought may be best represented by a detective, but it's quite a common thing to give ISTJs the detective role. I like your idea of having a shield or something, but I've currently assigned ISFJ the role of ""protector"". If you think ISTJ is better suited for that role I could change it, however.

That paragraph is a mess, so basically what I'm asking you right now is:

1) What kind of ""role"" do you think represents the nature of the ISTJ best? (Some examples of other ""roles"" I have are an activist for ENFJ, an archaeologist for ISTP, a strategist for INTJ, a diplomat for ESFJ, etc)

3) What stereotypes should I take care to avoid?

First MBTI. Before Eneagram.

Ne TI Fe Se look in to the invisible if you want later. 

Do you see yourself doing this, whether like, want or wish it. MBTI is about brain functions that’s natural to you.

The more scientific and more brain function way:

Ne” Extroverted intuition, this is how you think, You’re full of ideas, done, undone. Different possibilities. You’re good at brainstorming. You see more than one way to do things. More then way to life life. You see possibilities. Where as Ni break down, strip data from patterns you are good at recognizing patterns. Ne makes you inquisitive, curious. You have a lot of ideas that you may not do always.

TI: Introverted thinking, I say to people imagine Armchair philosopher. That sums the TI function. Like working your brain bbecause it’s fun, for the sake of it. Likes to solve complex problems just for doing so, and the stimulation you get. You don’t have to use it. You solve logic puzzles just for fun to figure out. It doesn’t need to be practical.

Ti dominants can be considered lazy maybe you’re a little bit, or at least that’s how people view you. You just like to have everything as well as possible but with the least amount of efforts.

Point 2 sounds like a Si-Ti loop, constantly analysing and reanalysing your past.

Point 3 can't really be attributed to a type, but the fact that you can cry over films and stuff probably suggest some higher level of empathy than most, which supports the introverted feeler claim. Feeling dudes often put on a stone face in public even when they just need to let it all out.

Point 4 obviously supports the sensor claim, but I'm not going to focus on the fact that you're aware of your surroundings as that's such an overused typing method and I don't think it's quite as accurate as people think.

The second question could be more a combination of Si and Ne, which it seems like you might have if your flair says ENFJ and you're asking about this. Of course, your description is vague enough to fall under stereotyped and inaccurate descriptions of Ni as well. Ni doesn't actually care about the one little piece, 99% of the time, though. Ni will ignore that little bit, because it's so damn sure about its notions removed from any data. 

Also active analyzation like what's implied at the beginning of that section sounds more Si. Ni is going to be completely unrelated and nonspecific mental imagery, and then suddenly you understand the implications of a theme you've been accidentally metabolizing off and on for a while, but it's not connected to any specific occurrence, and you don't notice that you've thought about it in the past as much as there is a new link that takes you down a rabbit hole of new images, that also aren't related to the present situation.

Si doesn't make decisions, Fe does (sort of), so an ISFJ's Fe plays more into decision-making than Si. 

&gt; I've been shy through most of my life but until the summer between between middle and high school. I wasn't very big on initiating conversations and was your stereotypical shy smart nerd. This why I believed I was an ISFJ, because I wasn't big on talking to others if I didn't have a purpose to do so.

I used to think I was an ISTJ for the reasons you described, but I feel pretty confident with ESTJ now, so ESFJ is possible.

&gt; Delving into the function side of things, I see myself using a high amount of Fe in how I act in the more harmony side of it. Ever since I was little I hated conflict.

This is generally a ""friendly person"" thing more than a Fe thing specifically.

This sounds pretty ISFJ. ISFJs are pretty passive, while ESFJs are typically more interventionist in those scenarios, getting in there and sorting things out. Despite being F-doms, the ExFJs are quite dominant and assertive.

This is probably because people describe Ne as ""creativity"" and ""open-mindedness"", which is incorrect. You don't need to have strong use of Ne to embody either of these traits. ISFJs can be very creative and appear quite abstract, and that isn't just because of developed Ne.

More the better, and the least effort the possible.” Also, TI is responsible for how do I say this as precise as possible?
Ne: Extroverted intuition, think either creativity and possibility. A lot of people online use Ne or try to, when in fact it’s not who they are axu or dom. Usually good at brainstorming, finding creative things to do. Can spot patterns well, and construct patterns they see or construct patterns.
Ni: introverted intuition, some signs is if they are Ni dominant overstimulation is very likely. Easily overwhelmed. They live a lot in their heads like Ne. Maybe more? Since NI is an introverted function.! They can spot patterns and extrapolate patterns from things they see. Break about these patterns for abstract pattern. This is the analyzer who has these type of analyzations that is spot on but often isn’t that concrete and specific. If you want specific you ask Si people. The detail just.... slip... away... and, then it’s gone!!!! It’s almost dream like withe the details. They focus on the processes in how they think a lot.
FI: introverted feeling, what can I say, these people llive to feel their own emotions. They are very in tune with their own beat, emotions, moral and values. They live there practical. “I have to feel like it!!” They practically live in their feelings. They are very conscientious about expressing it because they don’t want to offend you. They understand how they feel, how to control their emotions, can be moody, but generally good at emotional quotient. If you want to describe how they feel they are usually the ones to tell you. I think Fi people like talking themselves and their inner values. It’s also known as authenticity. They just have to be them. Fi rather offend others but stay authentic.
Fe: Extroverted feeling, think, empathy, emotional mind reading. They sometimes find it hard to read themselves, but they do have inside feelings. They are more familar with outside emotions and other feelings. Sometimes they feel like the other people. I think but I could be wrong defend the underdog type of attitude. They want to offend no one, and rather offend. Themselves. An fe told me recently on here, if she hung around another fe, they both got drained because how the other felt they would feel. They like harmony. If Joe bob and Jane was in argument, they focused on emotional cohesion. Where Te may focus on a common solution Fe would focus on emotional solutions. Fe like Te gives support but differently. Fe gives emotional support. Joe is sad, Fe supports Joe emotionally and makes him feel better. My Fe friend said in his profile, something to this effect, “I love to make people feel good about themselves. I love to laugh and make others laugh.” Te would focus on saying, “okay you have this problem. Sorry to hear that. Well, do this and it will fix your issue.”
Se: extroverted sensing, These people are really in the moment. They love raw data. They observe and pay attention to their five senses in great detail and do not interpret it. When I think se I think my father. He got so successful because he empolyed his dominant function in his job. My dad was fashion for the longest time, now he does logistics. He can see a shirt, maybe touch it, and tell you the color, but not just blue green, orange, ETC... He can tell you stuff like, this is fuchsia, at this many percent. This is called this technical color. This shirt is made of this specific yarn or whatever fabric, It’s knit, wollen, ETC... He does not have to look at a tag. He did production work many years and had basically to be quality control, sometimes sent down to the factories to inspect cloth in great detail. Then, tell them how to fix it. You know those guess how many is there of this x object in this jars, whether it’s marbles, starbursts, pennies, quarters, push pins, ETC... He’s usually really close. Dad and I had a lunch date one day, the noodles I had were different. The first thought was “They are all irregular shapes and all different.” They are very attracted to the things that look good in this world. Sort of what people think of when they think sensor. NOt all sensors are like this though. Their first trait is very raw, and lots of it spoken aloud. My father is also a good driver, notices every detail in the roads and all around him. Probably amongst one of the best drivers you can find. They are extremely in the moment. They focus on the here and now. They don’t do a lot of sensing comparing, that’s SI.
 Si: introverted sensing. They take senses and compare. If when I use SI which is my second fuction, yes that makes me Te and si and ESTJ. But when I use it, it’s like sensing comparing. This noodle is harder then the other one. This jacket is more fuzzy then that other one. That’s the stuff that comes to mind. SI is also very concrete factual information. In a research while the Ni takes apart patterns and notices them, and uses data from it, the SI use a lot of factual, concrete, precise, data and examples. I am good at specific examples. History is also a Si thing, and pulling factual concrete examples from it. Following examples from the past. Si dominant are also good at schedules and routines and sort of need them. Si, takes Data and internalizes and remembers it and compares it. Being accurate is really natural for SI people.. They are in the here and now, not in dreamland but not like SI. They don’t like raw data, they processes their senses and come up with some data. Usually a comparison. How it seems to them. SI uses this process to gage normalcy and conventionality of the data, fact, sense, ETC....

So to type someone quickly or at all, and this is the fastest way and the best take two of those. The best two from someone. I usually ask subtle questions. For a valid type one fuction is introverted and one is extroverted. Both can’t be exroverted and introverted. Also if they are an an introvert the leading function is introverted. An extrovert it would be a leading extroverted function. For introvert perceiving functions comes firstt and extroverts a judging/acting function comes first. If they are a judger. If they are a perceiver the opposite. Is the case.
Si ni Se Ne are perceiving functions.
TE TI Fi Fe are judging acting functions.  
Se: ESFP ESTP dominant ISTP ISFP auxiliary
Si: ISTJ ISFJ dominant ESTJ ESFJ auxiliary
Ne: ENTP ENFP dominant INFP INTP auxiliary
Ni: INTJ INFJ Auxiliary ENTJ ENFJ auxiliary
Fe: ENFJ ESFJ dominant INFJ ISFJ auxiliary
Fi: INFP Isfp Dominant ENFP ESFP auxiliary
Te: ESTJ ENTJ dominant INTJ ISTJ auxiliary
TI: INTP ISTP dominant ENTP ESTP auxiliary

So the first two function of each type looks like this.
INTJ: NI TE
ENTJ: TE Ni
ESTJ: Te SI
ISTJ: SI Te
ISFJ: Si Fe
ESFJ: FE SI
ENFj: FE NI 
INfJ: Ni Fe

883655,"ENTJs and ESTJs are pretty different. I can't say I've ever been unsure between the two if I'm typing someone by functions. ENTJs are short-term thinkers on long-term ideas. ESTJs are long-term thinkers using short term ideas. 

I'm concerned about implementing any changes if I can't figure out 1. how it's an improvement on what already is and 2. if that improvement is going to last. I want the absolute most bang for my buck if I'm going to change a system- obviously less important with things like 'how will I arrange my sock drawer?' but much more important with things like 'what lesson changes have to happen for this in-class program curricula to be more effective?'. The curricula could impact people for a very long time even though the changes are small, so it needs to be carefully considered.

The ENTJs I know are a lot more content to just come up with ideas of change for the sake of ideas and toy with them in their head/with others for a while, and the implementation is one of the last things they're concerned with. The implementation is secondary- they just want their idea to start being processed so they can move onto the next and come to pat themselves on the back once the first idea is manifested (aka the hands on 'dirty work' of actually making it reality is finished).

Ultimately I find ENTJs are more prone to throwing the baby out with the bathwater in an effort to manifest quick results that are exactly what they are predicting, and ESTJs are more prone to overthinking possibilities of how to implement something in an effort to pick the best, best, best one.

1563922,"Ne makes associations between things very quickly. Being extraverted, they are objective associations, however, so the associations are able to be understood by others pretty easily (for example, it's often easier to follow an ENTP's train of thought than an INTJ's train of thought because the INTJ's train of thought is so influenced and altered by their subjective experiences). So, there's a thought that might be lurking in the back of everyone else's head, but the Ne-user will actually voice this association, which brings a sort of amused satisfaction to the people around them. ""I wasn't going to go there, but yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, haha.""

This especially applies to SJs, who have Ne lower in the stack but still valued. They're unlikely to jump to the exact same association as quickly as a Ne-dom would, but the idea might be floating around in there, so when the Ne-user actually voices what the SJ has been thinking all this time, it's like one has finally met the voice in their head, and that can be really funny (or at least I find it funny). SPs, on the other hand, have poor Ne and don't value it. Perhaps this is too anecdotal to draw conclusions from, but based on my observations, they tend to find NP's jokes annoying or try-hardy. I've started branching out a bit from the original topic now, but that's how I've come to understand dual/conflict relationships when talking about Ne.",ESTJ,246,1426,mbti
889956,"&gt; Also consider IQ tests, apparently INTJ and INTP do the best at these.

&gt; How can this be, if they share nothing in common? Makes absolutely no sense.

... I literally pointed out that I do think they have things in common.

That being said, I could argue that people with higher IQs are just more likely to test as INTs rather than INTs being more likely to have high IQs. Most intelligent people can easily think in abstracts and likely spend a fair bit of time thinking, meaning they'll very often get IN even if they're really an ES, and the T kind of explains itself.

&gt; I don't need evidence, the cognitive functions stack we all subscribe to needs evidence.

I feel like you do need evidence. You could even start by linking the article you read. 

However, I don't think that a system like Socionics or MBTI have to be as reliant on hard evidence. It's not neuroscience. It's based on observation and experimentation, which is then translated into a theory to explain people's thought processes. If someone doesn't seem to ""fit"" into that theory, there probably is an explanation, it might just be harder to find. But wait, doesn't that seem silly, to find someone who breaks your system and then find elaborate reasoning to back it up? Well, sort of, but not really. It's just a practical lens of analysing one's psyche. It doesn't have to work 100% of the time, there are other perspectives you can use, this is just a specific one that might be helpful sometimes.

Just as a disclaimer though, I do a lot of organization work and absolutely adore that particular direction of the game, so expect some bias there.
  
Personally, when it comes to PvP, unless it's for some sort of objective, I usually don't bother. To me it just wastes too much money given how much time and effort it takes to earn it, and it's hardly ever fun for both parties (usually a PvP player harassing someone who just wants to PvE with others). That being said, I opt for friendly competition if at all possible. If I'm playing Piracy Prevention and it finishes, I stop attacking and go away. If someone takes a bounty off of me, I don't get upset about it. I actually do use Passive Mode and Invite Only sessions if either of those meet the needs of what I want to do. However, beyond just not picking a fight with everyone constantly like Freemode is some giant CoD deathmatch, I really do believe there's a sense of fairness in *how* people fight. Winning isn't everything, sure, but hopelessly losing all the time isn't fun either. If you don't feel like you have a remotely decent way to fight back against someone and they're just rolling you over and over and over, it usually becomes a test of your patience that you inevitably fail. I empathize with this notion in the people I play against and get off my high horse when I realize I'm upsetting another player instead of trying to run them dry like some sort of sadistic social vampire that feeds on the frustration of others.

I quote Nietzsche:

&gt; Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market-place, and cried incessantly: ""I am looking for God! I am looking for God!""
As many of those who did not believe in God were standing together there, he excited considerable laughter. Have you lost him, then? said one. Did he lose his way like a child? said another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? or emigrated? Thus they shouted and laughed. The madman sprang into their midst and pierced them with his glances.


&gt; ""Where has God gone?"" he cried. ""I shall tell you. We have killed him - you and I. We are his murderers. But how have we done this? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained the earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving now? Away from all suns? Are we not perpetually falling? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is it not more and more night coming on all the time? Must not lanterns be lit in the morning? Do we not hear anything yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we not smell anything yet of God's decomposition? Gods too decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console ourselves? That which was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us? With what water could we purify ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we need to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whosoever shall be born after us - for the sake of this deed he shall be part of a higher history than all history hitherto.""


&gt; Here the madman fell silent and again regarded his listeners; and they too were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern to the ground, and it broke and went out. ""I have come too early,"" he said then; ""my time has not come yet. The tremendous event is still on its way, still travelling - it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds require time even after they are done, before they can be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the distant stars - and yet they have done it themselves.""

1304034,"Sorry if I was a bit harsh previously, I'm quickly angered (and perhaps a bit too quick to the draw) when it comes to right-wing fundamentalism. Honest mistake on both sides, I guess?

This is basically the same discussion that is being had whenever Germany's ban on swastikas and Nazi memorabilia comes up: Does it in fact take away the attention from the group we want to contain, or is it even more attention for them? If you ban traditional Muslim clothing, it will make it harder for fundamentalists to represent their ideology on the streets, but it will make it easier to tell those they wish to recruit ""See? They are treating our traditions like dirt! We need to take action against them!"" behind closed doors.

It feels a bit too all-encompassing to me when equating KKK uniforms to traditional religious clothes, purely because there is a possibility that somebody would wear the latter for other reasons than because they are Islamists. I'm no Muslim, so I don't know for a fact if all burqas automatically identify a family that is sympathetic to ISIS or Al-Qaeda, since the original intent of the outfit centuries ago was not to be a uniform for terrorists, as opposed to the KKK clothing or Nazi uniforms. Nobody wears a KKK uniform for other reasons than aligning themselves with the KKK, but there is at least a chance that somebody wears a burqa for some reason that doesn't include fundamentalism. (Again: Not saying ISIS et al. is less dangerous than the KKK.)

On a political level, it feels like pondering to the right-wing crowd without actually benefitting anybody directly, that's why I initially compared it to punks: I bet there are lots of senior citizens that would love it if somebody would force punks (or other counter-cultures) to wear ""proper"" clothes because they feel threatened by their outfit; but it would do next to nothing about the person inside the clothes.

heritage of dictatorships, including the National Socialists.

The word ""Volk"", as used in the words ""völkisch"" or ""Umvolkung"", which were put into the public debate last year, is in this case (like in national socialism) not synonymous to the whole population of a nation, but for an ethnic category which excludes parts of the population.

Your attitude is poor. You're complaining that the social convention is unfair. It is what it is. Hate the game not the player.

But really... Your position is irrelevant since the *opportunity* to meet and make an assessment of a potential partner was equal for both parties. Monetary expenditure was expected and it is considered negligible compared with the value of this opportunity. The woman could have offered to pay for things, yes. But that doesn't mean her behavior was exploitative.

Don't call the girl a bitch for reserving the right to make a decision. And equally don't make foregone conclusions based on casual flirtation. Do not assume that the girl intended to use the guy... However i would say that due to the way this interaction played out... it is fairly obvious that the guy intended to use the girl. It's not fair the make that assumption - but clearly the girl made a decision after meeting him and finding him creepy.

Don't criticize the girl for being smart / sensitive enough to detect that. It is actually part of *the reason* why the social convention is potentially unfair.

Look at what you are suggesting.

Somebody's gonna call me a white knight for this. So let me explain where i'm coming from... I like to change my mind all the time. *And i have had sex forced on me by a woman*. This has happened more than one time. I am not physically weak... I am a guy who has had sex when he didn't really want sex. *Isn't that shocking*!? Okay fine, I wouldn't call it rape because it's inevitable that somebody will say ""a woman can't rape a man"" but you're not really thinking about it. I also very much resent the comment ""guys are always horny so it doesn't count"".

Sure there's a requirement of an erection... but honestly it's a bullshit argument to assert that the presence of an erection means i want to put my dick in you. It's not rocket science... Suck it and it will get hard. That is biology. And it's actually surprisingly difficult to stop someone sucking your dick even if you don't really want them to. Where do you put your hands? How hard are they going to grab it? Can they emotionally handle this rejection?

Physically, *most* woman are not able to overwhelm me. Physical force is not the only kind of coercion. You can actually see an alternative type of coercion in the harsh tone and (poorly asserted) social pressure applied by the guy in this original post. That is why i take it quite seriously.

1016096,"I'll give it a go! (*little bit tongue in cheek*)

&gt; (1) What makes you respect individuals, groups, or organizations? List whatever you can think of.

Individuals; attractiveness (not in a sexist context), intelligence (rationality) and problem solving capacity (mental agility), inspiration strengths (varied).

Groups; compassion and inclusiveness. I like to contribute toward group activities either in an encouraging way or leading the charge. I like an atmosphere where anything could be said and there is a diversity of activities. This is why social gaming has been compelling but the same rules apply to IRL offline situations. I like to move around a group and interact with lots of people.

Organizations; support and liberty. A pay check. Valuable resources of knowledge. I do not think that many organizations are appropriately deserving of respect due to the conceited philosophy of capitalism. However that doesn't mean i'm anti capitalistic.

&gt; (2) What kind of things turn you off about a person, a brand/company, or a particular environment? What gets under your skin (in a bad way)?

I don't like it when people are manipulative without understanding that they are doing it. This happens a lot.

With brands and companies i tend to go off them if they start absorbing the competitive landscape or contribute toward price fixing.

Environments where i do not feel welcome i tend to leave. Unless there's something to fuck with out of spite.

Things that get under my skin; prejudice, irrationality, hate speech, ignorance, excuses for inaction.

&gt; (3) How good is your memory for detail? Specific conversations you've had in the past, little tasks that need to get done, what you were doing the first time you heard a song or tried a food, etc.

Pretty fucking good really. I can remember the details of conversations that are months old. But only if that conversation had some impact.

I suck at remembering little tasks that need doing. Tend to hve to write that stuff down.

I struggle to remember the context around memories that involve first impressions for things like music and food. Perhaps it would be more useful to talk about first impressions of a location? I have an accurate and detailed memory of things that i like. I enjoy food and music - these things can mean something to me - but they do not evoke memories of the first time as my current experience is more important.

Sometimes i may get melancholy listening to old (familiar) songs that i emotionally connect to an past time.

&gt; (4) What do you spend the most time thinking about - the past, the present, the future? Practical topics, logistical issues, relationships with people, theoretical concepts, issues of morality/ethics? Do you find yourself fixating on one thing, coming back to it, and trying to figure it out, or are you more prone to meandering through multiple tangentially related topics? Do you often daydream/space out? When you do daydream or fantasize, what kind of things do you imagine and think about?

I mostly think about the present and the near future. Recent past events may be analyzed before moving on - but the point is to keep moving forward. I do not like to consider logistical issues unless there is a specific challenge to navigate. Theories are interesting to me for what they represent in a predictive application. I am obsessed with the accurate truth. Secondary to subjects of personal interest i am interested in *my* relationships with other people for relaxation, inspiration, affirmation and debate. I don't care much for gossip but i'll happily provide people with gossip if they want to talk about me.

&gt; (5) Think about a topic or two you're really interested in and like having conversations about. Do you think you would generally have more fun talking about that topic with an enthusiastic, curious listener who asks you lots of great questions, or do you think you would generally have more fun listening to an interesting, entertaining person talk at length about it and answer your questions enthusiastically?

I like to tell people the things that i know. I'm good at telling stories and i enjoy the process. Asking questions is fine but sometimes detracts from the core point being conveyed. I'm usually fairly patient, however, and can handle interruptions. Equally if the other person seems fairly well informed on the topic i will entertain their speculations as long as they make rational sense to me. I often find it difficult to learn a direct lesson without proving the material right away (which is often inappropriate or inconvenient in education). I tend to disregard information that cannot be verified.

&gt; (6) In the last question, what topic(s) were you think about?

Physics, Astronomy and the nature of existence / reality (which might extend into chemistry and biology / anthropology). Game mechanics (not theory, mechanics in this context means discussing proven winning strategy only). Cognitive science. Philosophy. Music and culture.

&gt; (7) If someone is doing something that you strongly disagree with, how likely are you to confront them about it? If you do confront them, how do you usually tend to do it? How does your answer change depending on your relationship with the person, and whether their actions directly affect you?

If i strongly disagree then i may wait patiently until an opportunity to interrupt and state my case. Or i may interject immediately depending on severity. My interaction would have to be rational, justified and make a difference before i engage. My confrontation would be direct and get to the point quickly. I would intentionally make an effort to balance the intensity of my contribution to the situation.

Relationship to the person may affect the degree of tact or it may provide a means of contextual comparison which negates the need for intensity in having an impact. The degree to which i respect this individual *and* the degree that this individual respects my opinion is relevant to the amount of care taken in the interaction. I have no problem deliberately winding up close friends to serve a purpose (i would include entertainment value as a valid purpose).

&gt; (8) How interested are you in trying new things - traveling, trying strange and exotic foods, going on roller coasters, jumping out of airplanes, things like that? Regardless of how interested you are, how willing would you be to do those things if someone asked you to? How often do you actually do things like that? Give examples.

I frequently make impulse decisions to break my routine. I am very comfortable exploring. I get my bearings very quickly and am keen to adopt new experiences. I have traveled to many places; France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Dubai, China, Australia, Canada, East coast and West coast US, the Netherlands.

I am very keen on roller coasters and have been for as long as i can remember. I enjoy the feeling of loss of control whilst rationally understanding that i am not in real danger. My disposition would immediately change if presented with real danger.

I am very willing to experience new situations and activities. Some encouragement to complete the task or set an appropriate plan for doing an activity in future is much appreciated.

513826,"&gt; I'm white and my wife is Indian. Is it likely she would experience racism? Would integrating with the locals be difficult?

I don't think so. As /u/Kirmes1 said: it might be problematic in far Eastern Germany but otherwise you'll be fine. Unlike other European countries, Germany is rather multicultural.

&gt; Is it difficult to obtain ingredients for international cooking, such as Indian or Mexican dishes?

Not really. For some exotic ingredients you might have to look for a special store but you can easily find those in every larger city. And you'll find other ingredients at well-assorted supermarkets like Edeka or Rewe.

&gt; What areas would you recommend that are safe and suitable for families? We are coming from a relatively safe suburban area in the US. 

Safe and suitable suburbs *I know* are Neuss,  Bergisch Gladbach, Brühl, Königswinter / Bad Honnef and Viersen. Those are all in North Rhine-Westphalia, Western Germany. But I recommend looking for a suitable job first and then deciding on the location.

&gt; Do most employers require knowing German before hiring a foreigner? I know basic German.

Yes, definitely. Understanding and speaking *at least* basic German is very important for most employers (except your working for an internationally operating company and even then German is recommended).

Here's an alternative interpretation of F/T functions that I've read on a website long ago. There are basically two driving forces behind all of human social interactions: these are competition and cooperation. What separates T from F is that:   
- Tx functions are designed for competition - Ti/Te values are more impersonal and discordant - Ti/Te types are better equipped situations where there is a need to enter into conflict, argue, criticize, put up a ""no b.s."" attitude even if it upsets someone, overcome, supercede, organize people to do some work, demand something, etc.    
- Fx functions are designed for cooperation - their values are more personal and harmonious - so Fi/Fe types are perceptive and confident in situations when there is a need to compromise, sympathize, discharge conflict, harmonize relationships, cooperate with someone, reconcile or encourage others to reconciliation, etc.   
   
Every type has both T &amp; F functions, so each person is capable of both of course. But depending on where the T/F are in the functional stack, you'll be lopsided and will feel more comfortable and confident with either one side or the other.

-**Having the opportunity to help students improve their confidence and realize their potential.**  I love to encourage people, and everyone knows the impact that a good teacher can have.  Teachers have changed my life.

-**Great outlet for creativity.**  I loved planning my lessons and figuring out the best way to get knowledge into my students' brains.  I also loved the challenge of how different all my students were and loved trying to adapt my teaching to each student.

**Cons:**

-**Often felt the pressure to appear extroverted in front of a classroom of students.**  This was incredibly draining.

-**Classroom management.**  I am naturally very permissive and don't like conflict, so this was a challenge for me.  You need to make expectations and consequences very clear and provide structure and routine so that students feel safe.  This is challenging when you love your students and want to make exceptions for them.

-**Making a million interpersonal decisions every day sapped my willpower.**

-**No work-life balance.**  This differs from person to person, but I am such a perfectionist that I worried constantly about creating the best lessons.  I felt like a failure if they were sub-par.  I also spent hours and hours overanalyzing conversations I'd had with students, parents, and teachers.  Did I do the right thing?  How do I handle this situation?  I could go on.

-**Worrying about the inherent power of the position.**  Students will naturally trust you and come to you for advice.  This can be rewarding at times, but I lived in constant fear of giving the wrong advice and unintentionally fucking someone up or having a negative impact on someone's life.

I'm sure I've left things off both lists, but I hope this provides a little perspective.  Ultimately, you have to make your own decision and will likely have a different list of pros and cons than I do.",INFJ,360,2158,infj

Speak to your own limitations and say that as much as you would love to be the one to help fix this, and get her feeling back to her most genuine, amazing self that this is something that you don't have training in.  

If she says, ""I don't know how you can love me when I am depressed,"" do not say ""I love you anyway"".  *Anyway* means that depression is a bad quality and that you are technically going out of your way to do something extra to care for her. 

As much as possible try to separate the ""depression"" from her. You wouldn't say to someone ""I'm cancerous"". You'd say, ""I have cancer.""  Talking about the depression as something she has rather than something she is will also help remind her that she is not this disorder and that she has that wonderful, amazing self to come back to. That part of her is still there. So if she says, ""I'm so depressed"", you say, ""I know you are going through depression right now"" or ""i know you are feeling depressed"" something like that. 

Never say, ""I know how you feel"". Whenever that temptation arises, say, ""I can only imagine what that must feel like.""

Final thought: encourage treatment. Depression doesn't randomly get better on its own. And you can't help her the way she most needs it. It's like wanting to give your loved one a life changing surgery without a medical degree. You don't get to be the surgeon, but you get to be the guy who holds her hand while she's recovering.

I mean...how much do you want to know? We actually live in a country where they post the most interesting stuff openly on government websites, knowing that 99% of America will treat all of the information available like terms of service agreements on websites. Or Rediquette. You just assume you know and move on.

The United States runs two overarching intelligence ""programs"" that divide into approximately twenty divisions of eighteen agencies proper. There are currently 1,350 additional government organizations in the programs, 2,900+ private companies, all having around 25,000 locations in the US. 40% of the US Intel community right now are private employees and co-opted contractors who come from think tank pools, research organizations and big corporate. 

We have a million plus people working with basic TS clearances as of this year. OICI and then the triad INR, I&amp;A and NGA work with the NRO on projects that take precedence. In general, they are the parallel tier to what would be Military Intelligence, with some crossover. The National Intelligence Programs and Military Intelligence Programs are very similar, but very diverse in their goals. Basically, you can align one to two major corporations or industry leading companies with every major agency. Google is an oddball. The reason Google is odd is because it's enormous. And so many different types of companies tie into it. It basically ties into being an independent intelligence agency and it offers shared information in kind, as well as stacks data. I mean...where do you think Android came from and why? Realistically, it was an attempt to do what Apple did with their ""eco-system"". 

The thing that people won't tell you as much is this:

For every government thing you know is going on that is sketchy, there is a shadow function just like it. I am sure the initials above won't mean the same thing to everyone on the thread, but take a look at what just the NGA does and see how and why they might be closely aligned with Google. 

If you want to run the theory down further, take a look at ""Warrant Canaries"" and look closely at the languages of how they describe communication carriers. Also look at what they are doing there strictly in the sense of Company to Customer relations. Find a list of the current companies required to carry transparency reports with it. Once you get to this point in the reading, your head should explode, so...there's no reason to go much further.

Most people say the NSA and I have to tell you....there isn't much to the NSA. They are the least scary group of the bunch.

But if you want to start at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and start your way down through the games of chutes and ladders that make up the domestic US Intelligence Community, you could make a really fun new board game out of it. 

The scariest thing in all of this to me...the Affordable Care Act and the future of healthcare records online. Most people didn't read the fine print in that act. Want some terrifying Orwellian shit that isn't what people talk about, read that shit. There are no microchips or bullshit in there....they scare you by leaking those stories. What they don't want to say is...ho hum, we'd like to keep your healthcare record tied to you directly, online...you know, under lock in key. Because...uh, it'll be safe. Yeah. It'll be safe. 

And the actual watchdog over the OPM, who safeguards all these people who safeguard all YOU people (and me) is the US GAO and those two entities never learned how to be over prepared like the IRS and SSA. They are two of the most overtaxed agencies in the world and they are the darlings of the ball. You want to get to the money, those are the one's who's pants you have to get into, right there.

I am currently agnostic/deistic, but I went through a period of really, *really* desiring to feel and communicate with God, gods, etc. I had several friends that were very Christian (American south, baptist, little country churches and little Christian k-12 schools) and I followed their sincerely offered help and advice. I felt like I had found the connections I was looking for - love as a basis for community. 

I started attended church and that slowly led me *back* to agnosticism... The ideals of the churches I attended, the people I heard speak seemed to counter the idea of love and acceptance that drew me. The exclusivity of Christianity (and of many religions) didn't make sense. The hate and judgment that was passing as religious truth would make me cry after each church service - I wanted to experience this overwhelming love of a deity but could not justify the other beliefs that the religion brought with it.

I think I still desire, even *hunger* for a feeling of connectedness and belief in something bigger, but religions that tie in beautiful beliefs with hate and justification for exclusivity and judgement can't reach that connectedness.

&gt;What do you admire/value in a long-term relationship from your significant other?

Honesty, empathy, and the ability to effectively communicate.  A willingness to growth and constant improvement, the ability to admit when they are wrong, and ability to express emotion.  I also need to spend a lot of time with my partner. :)

&gt;If you feel a strong connection towards an INFP, does it feel intimate or illusory?

I haven't knowingly had one, so I couldn't really say!

&gt;Is there some kind of void in you that you wish other people would step in and fill?

I am not entirely sure what you mean by this question.  I definitely feel the need to be loved and accepted but I don't feel a void.  I have emotional issues that stem from childhood and a fear of being abandoned, but I have been in intensive therapy and no longer feel that ""void"" where my lack of attachment occurred as a child.

&gt;Does it irritate you when people aren't completely direct with you in order to spare your feelings?

Yes, absolutely.  It feels invalidating of my experience because they make a judgement about how I am going to feel and because they are trying to then control the way I feel.  

&gt;Does it upset you when people are too direct with you and disregard your feelings?

It depends on the person and my relationship with them, but I find it really difficult to connect and interact with people who do not express empathy.

&gt;Is there a ""perfect balance"" between being too sensitive and too direct? If so, what is that?

There certainly is a balance but I am going to use a little bit different language.  So instead of saying someone is being ""too sensitive"" or ""two direct"", I would describe it as someone thinking more with their ""emotional mind"" or more with their ""logical mind"".  The balance between the two would be considered your wise mind.  This is where you would recognize and consider your feelings, recognize and consider the feelings of the other person, and decide how to act accordingly given the set of circumstances you are in, in a way that is going to cause the least amount of suffering in the long run to both people.

&gt;Most importantly, how would you describe experiencing introverted intuition (Ni)?

I enjoy few deep emotional connections to many surface level friendships.  I require alone time but enjoy myself the most in the company of one or two other people.  However, I am good at socializing because I can read a situation well, assess it, and adapt accordingly. I can read peoples' minor and otherwise undetectable changes in body language and facial expression, often times I can tell when someone feels something before it registers with them.  I am incredibly introspective and spend a lot of time meditating and reflecting which leads me to be increasingly self-aware.  I can be very expressive and emotive but I stop and assess my situation before deciding how to act instead of reacting.",INFJ,533,3155,infj
655954,"I agree with the diagnosis (giant unchecked egos). That's the nature of a dominant Pi function. We rely first and foremost on perceiving how things/ideas affect us. By definition, we're focused on ourselves, and we tend to overgeneralize those perceptions to everyone else. INFJs and ISFJs are less inclined to let it show, but it's there.

I disagree with the prescription (really need someone constantly telling them they suck). At least for INFJs, that will indeed exacerbate the problem. We'll just get even more self-focused, only it'll be on our weaknesses, how we *think* people perceive us, etc. In general I think we really just need to be heavily engaged in our auxiliary and tertiary functions (Fe and Ti for INFJs) to snap us out of Pi ruts and give us others' perspectives / more logical perspectives.

It's to the point where it is really difficult to differentiate between the two in my head but maybe thats because I'm so frustrated over this right now. I know people can grow and develop other functions by choice so maybe thats got something to do with it. I can do the whole Fi thing and place myself in others shoes and offer forms of advice from my perspective. At times I do find it difficult to completely relate in terms of emotions. On the other hand when it comes to Ni I often think I see the roots of someones issue from a slightly more separated perspective and offer advice accordingly. If it doesn't work then I come up with something else using a mixture of both logic/intuition and emotion. 

If I really think about it I honestly feel like Ni has been more prevalent in my life. Even when Fi comes up it doesn't feel really strong in the way of having an emotional effect on me. I'm more concerned with finding the roots through verbal and nonverbal ques and offering advice based on that.

I say I can see a relation to my Astrological chart in that INFJ is about relating through intuition and empathy and then using that data to formulate solutions. I have the sun sign of Scorpio which is very intuitive in terms of cutting through facades. Someone can tell me one thing but I sense something different in their mannerisms or vocal patterns. When I have an interest in something I go all out until I have gained all the knowledge/experience that I care to gain, then I move onto the next thing. My Ascendant is Virgo and Virgo is about that drive to help and please others which is something I strive to do when I feel I'm able, like it's my responsibility.

It happened, it's done, and you can't take that back, but you can move forward and learn from that experience and become better from it. 

I'm also an INFJ and recently started seeing a therapist as well. I had an experience fairly recently that sent me into the same kind of isolation and replaying past events and what I did wrong and what else I should have done to an almost compulsive degree. As I was explaining this to my therapist, she noticed how much I was just beating myself up for it and asked how this negative self-talk could possibly help me or anyone around me. She suggested I read this book ""Self-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself"" by Kristen Neff. I haven't even fully finished reading the book, but I think it's a worthwhile read, especially for someone going through what you're feeling. 

Be kind to yourself. Forgive yourself. And even though it may seem like it's not a lot, thank yourself for even posting this, for sharing these feelings with us.

Both involve a lot of grinding away at textbooks. I really dislike the 'ENTP lawyer' stereotype. ENTPs argue to get to the truth. Lawyers argue to make everybody think a particular thing, they are not interested in whether that particular thing is actually true or not. They are the polar opposite of one another.

According to my spreadsheet, I've met 9 ENTPs in my life, and 3 of them have been more 'high flying' types. They all had the same things in common - female, very attractive, very intelligent, ridiculously insecure. I think the three of them were all like...they weren't really 'feminine' and thought that femininity was stupid and had no intention of ever being feminine. So because they didn't fall into their stupid 'gender roles', they were massively underappreciated by everybody around them, because people are assholes. Guys were intimidated by them and girls were jealous of them. So they all ended up with this underlying Te-style drive to accrue like, 'big house, well paying job, tall good looking husband' and so on because they felt like there was no way they could get other people to take them seriously otherwise.

Depending on their body language, most of the time when you stand strong they will adjust and rethink their decision to argue. If they still do, let them say what they want and only after that calmly explain to them the rules or send them off the field, depending on what they said (if it is a personal thing then send them away to cool down).

And usually when you start doing something, its easy to continue, cos you see that you are moving in and the results of your first actions.

For instance, if you need to vacuum your room. Think about getting the vacuum cleaner out of the closet and inclusing it in the socket, set it as a minigoal. think ""yea, i could prolly do it right now"". And it would be something done, and would take like 10 seconds. Dont think about ""yea but my bigger goal in cleaning the whole room, wouldnt be achieved, so it pointless to get out vacuum cleaner, it brings nothing to the table.. etc."", just consider it as a separate task. Something that would be done, as you plug it to socket. 

If you need to wash dishes, think about washing up one dish, or even just moving to the kitchen and opening water.

If you need to study, think about opening up the book and reading 3 lines. (Just 3 lines, easy. ""i can do it? yes i can. lets see what these 3 lines would be, what it would bring""). Forget about the large goal, just concenrate on one first thing, what can be done/finished quickly.

Thats the trick i use all the time, just keeping reducing stuff you need to do to one first step, smaller and smaller until you feel an urge to do it, ""cos its so fucking easy to do and i can do it now in literally few seconds"". If you dont feel it yet, keep reducing to a smaller one goal/task/step until you feel an urge.

It all about getting started.

P.S. video games use it all the time, to keep you doing something, cos if there is an instant gratification of what you do and goal splitted into steps it almost automatically makes you want to do it. (Cos its so easy and can be done now, with an observed result). Like quest that go from 0/20 to 1/20, you feel you did something, something achieved, something changed. Or xp bar moving up, level progression etc. They need all these tools to keep you playing. thats how humans work.

So yea, first step rule!  I use it all the time, its really kinda obvious and nothing special (like splitting up goal into steps and stages, you heard it million times prolly), but its actually what works in getting stuff done, and make your human vehicle moving in the direction you need it to.

464620,"First off, I love your username!

I can't do it with every type of person, it's more of the kind of thing that their vibe or behavior reminds me of a friend that has that type or a description of that type, etc. Maybe it's a Si thing or maybe it's universal but my brain automatically compares current events to stored data all the time, everything is always being matched to a memory and categorized in that pile. If I remember ISTPs being a certain way, I perk up when someone does or says something that aligns with that, and if there are enough matches then I kind of assume they're that type unless proven otherwise with contradictory information. So basically a lot of it comes from experiences and research kind of flowing through my veins, as well as a habit of jumping to conclusions. The more you know and the more patient you are, the more accurate the conclusion will be. 

As far as things I notice, my first instinct is to look for signs/vibe of Fi vs Fe, because as a Fi Dom, Fi is kind of something I intuitively sense in people, but can also be observed based on how they interact with others. Determining Fi vs Fe helps me get two functions in the stack out of the way, and if their Dom function were Sx or Nx then boom game over. To determine their Dom I first take cues from what exhausts them. Both extroverts and introverts are drained by socializing and go off to themselves for a while but I've noticed that a lot of extroverts tend to become antsy and irritable when reflecting for too long and chase external stimulation for that release, whereas introverts are quickly drained when they've been expressing/stimulated for too long and savor that refueling reflection. When I narrow them down to extrovert/introvert that narrows their Dom function possibilities down from 8 to 4. Then I can simply compare which of each Xe/Xi function fits them better as a Dom, (I usually use descriptions and questions and observations to figure this part out) especially after eliminating Fi/Fe as an option if I determine either is not one of their preferences. (For example, if they're an extrovert that uses Fi somewhere their only options for Dom are Se, Ne, and Te.) If they are a Te or a Fi dom, determining Se vs Si use is pretty difficult for me, it has to be either really obvious like ""Dude, let's jump off this cliff right now!!"" or a gut feeling.

I'm a literature professor. I'm also an extreme introvert. I score 100% I on the Meyer-Briggs, for example. Psychometrically, I'm as introverted as they come.

The thing is, I often DO feel happier after acting like an extrovert.

I get nervous before a lecture to a big crowd, for example, but once I've started I love it. And I love being good at it. I need to recharge after, but it's something I choose to do for a living because I enjoy it.

The metric being measured here is happiness. Social connectedness is an important factor in 'happiness' scores on psychometric instruments generally. It is something that comes more easily to extroverts. Also, introversion and introspection correlate, and I can see how an inward focus could result in unhappiness if you're not a content, integrated person.

INFPs in prehistoric times (before first civilizations): likely to be shamans/spiritual people, likely to be obsessed with stars and fascinated by certain plants (drugs) and how they cause different states of consciousness. Anyways, depending on how much coercive the band of hunters-gatherers was, INFPs would likely feel as outsiders (if there was big coercion) or feel free to be themselves in the purest sense of the word (if there was little coercion).

INFPs in first civilizations: I think Çatalhöyük as a first proto-city (and the first civilization definitely) was definitely either Fi (=INFP) or Fe (=ENFJ) driven. People there weren't obsessed with status and would help their neighbors. It was definitely community driven. But civilizations after it (think of ancient Sumeria), I think it'd be a hell for INFPs. They'd be likely poor farmers unable to fullfill their dreams and would either imagine how it'd be like to live in the old times from mythological stories about their hunter-gatherer past or they would imagine how it would be like to just destroy their current society and replace it with a new one attuned to their own ideals.

INFPs in ancient Egypt/Greece/Rome/China: well, you'd still have a hard time doing all the backbreaking labor so you could feed your ruler(s) besides the family but it'd be certainly a great time to live for us. You could live your simple farmer's life or dream to be a poet, naval explorer, etc. And with a bit of luck, you'd become such a person.

INFPs in medieval Europe: with all the chivalry around, you'd either find INFPs in the knight's armor expressing their innermost feelings to a lady or in a monk's cape who's struggling in a dim light of a candle to rewrite ancient authors. Or you'd find INFPs as witches/druids in a pagan society.

INFPs in early stages of capitalism: this was a great time of great sea expeditions. Okay, if we ignore that most of these expeditions were just to conquer and dominate, there were some like La Pérouse expedition which only purpose was to explore, get knowledge about distant lands and treat any people they might encounter with respect and dignity they deserve. You could basically become anybody because only few people did the hardbreaking labor that is the farming, most of the people had other jobs and bought their food.

Personally, I always dreamt of being in some hunter-gatherer band which is struggling to survive thanks to another warrior band just over the hills. But I'd be happy because I could roam free with the animals, I'd be free to hunt or be hunted, I'd be free to dream and live mystical experiences, I'd be free to join another camp if trouble within my own one arose, etc. Or I'd be some mystical sage/druid/monk in any kind of civilization just minding my own business and exploring my own mind.",INFP,654,3768,infp

329637,"Yes. Two-year relationship, had an affair with a classmate, once I found out about her affair she said ""I don't need you anymore"". Changed her Facebook status with his new boyfriend and implied it was the best day of her life. She got pregnant immediately. She's now a single mother.

It was a disaster in every way; I had panic attacks almost everyday, nausea, lack of sleep, lack of eating, was so disgusted with myself I couldn't look myself at a mirror for a week; I felt useless, I felt abandoned, hurt, broken, rejected, betrayed, dumped. All at the same time. It was easily one of the worst things that ever happened to me.

But... at the end, I learned to be grateful. Even though it made me feel insecure about my future love life, I learned to be empathetic. I felt what it was crying alone at night with no one ever knowing to a whole new level and it hit me. How many people are in that condition?

That experience not only made me at peace at being an INFP but it helped me communicate that empathy in grief that I just couldn't do before... I learned to smile and laugh with honesty, to need and hold on to my friends, and let them hold on to me in return. I learned to not underestimate when someone is grieving from a broken heart and made some new accquaintances, I became some people's confident, some sort of guide to the terrible world of breakups. It made me feel... I don't know.

Back then I was (ex)'s boyfriend and not really recognized by many people; after that incident I learned to be contempt with myself (it tooks months, even years so don't worry if you're not there yet) and that experience made me learn three important things.


1. **It's okay to cry**. We all have things that makes us cry at night, even though we don't admit it. I don't say that we should be contempt with someone else's suffering. Absolutely not. But we are feelers, we know love in a way that not everyone does, and this is just the beginning of an introspective journey, something that will get you to know yourself better and define you as a person, it's your choice if you let this experience ruin you or bless you.

2. **It gives you the chance to know what to expect in your next relationship.** You won't stop thinking about your relationship for a while now, so use this oportunity to look at the bigger picture. What red flags you missed? What could you've done better? What could your ex have done better? Rescue all of those things that will make you say ""this won't happen again"". Learn from it. Embrace the whole thing. The good things and the bad things.

3. **There's no shame in love**. Some people like to get over that quickly, but I'm convinced that the time and intensity of your grief is proportionate to how much you loved that person; maybe he/she's having the time of his/her life now but believe me. That person missed the chance of being loved in a way that no one in the world could make him/her feel.

What's my point with all of this? It's that you persevered to the very end; you were the loyal one, you were the one willing to stay. Be proud of that. In a world where the shallow and the one-night stands are plenty, it's not bad to break the mold. Is it hard? Yep. Is it painful? Absolutely. But believe me, there will be people that are going to admire your resilience, and with how things are going, we need empathy and resilience more than anything in the world.

1128237,"&gt;Why not purposefully mistype him as any other type?

There's no reason for why not, but I'm just reasoning based on what actually happened, which is that Stephen Colbert got typed as an INFP by an MBTI practitioner. A possible reason for a purposeful mistype is because INFPs are some the most insecure people and would benefit emotionally most from thinking that someone they look up to is an INFP. Just how all the INFPs displayed in the threads. 

&gt;And as far as making a giant mistake, that's pretty much a copout. Why/how/in what way?

I'm not really sure what you're trying to get out of me. Mistakes can and do happen, tests very very often give incorrect results. The MBTI practitioner used a test (with which people can often answer idealistically or even dishonestly) that is based on a computer algorithm...I'm sure that if she and others took the time to type him with reason rather than rely on the machine's results they would have organically come to a conclusion on ENTP. 

&gt;""I think Colbert was accurately typed, because I'm pretty sure the practitioner is the best practitioner in the country. I don't think she ever makes mistakes. Also, I've known for years that Colbert was INFP. The reasons are all there, you just have to watch different videos of him to see it.""

Is she the best practitioner in the country? In the video they do call her an expert and that does give her credibility, but again I think that she herself knew he couldn't have been an INFP but didn't want to budge in and explain why the results were flawed, maybe in order to maintain the credibility of the test, or possibly thinking that there is no way her expert reasoning could possibly overrule the validity of a test and that somehow he must be an INFP because the test results said so. I've only tested INFP from one test, 25quiz.com, which self improves over time. All other tests I get either INTP or INTJ. If I had taken the official MBTI test for the first time a lot of my answers would have been very idealistic and/or dishonest and I most certainly would have scored INTx. You can't say she never makes mistakes because all people make mistakes, and again I think this was her mistake to not catch the test's fault, not really her mistake in her true judgement of Colbert. I do believe she knows he's probably not INFP but cared not to state that as to leave Colbert space for himself to decide.

And I have watched different videos of him. I've been watching clips since I first joined reddit as they get posted to /r/videos and just recently watched a few, including his recent piece with Jerry Seinfeld (Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee). I also think that it would be a lie if you said you've always thought Colbert was an INFP. 

It's all based on comparisons, images of people's mannerisms and pattern recognition. I know how INFPs tend to look and interact. I know what the Fi dominant weight looks like. Colbert doesn't have that weight, he appears much like an ENTP and I personally know a couple ENTPs very well, possibly ESTJ or ENFP if not. ",INFP,548,3068,infp

- Whitewater: Something about her and Bill investing in real estate and potentially conducting illegal activities while doing it. Verdict: FBI investigated, no connection to any illegal activity.


- Lewinsky Scandal: Bill had sex with another woman, he was guilty (it was consensual as far as we know), but obviously her husband's infidelities should not reflect badly on Hillary.



- Benghazi: The accusation that while she was Secretary of State, she had prior knowledge of the attacks on the American embassy in Benghazi, Libya, which killed the ambassador and another foreign service officer. Her mode of trial was being sat in front of an investigate committee (all Republicans if I remember correctly) and questioned for 11 straight hours. Verdict: Obviously the freaking Secretary of State didn't want our embassy to be attacked. No evidence found. Duh.



- Emails: Instead of using her gov't. email address all the time while she was Sec. of State she set up a private server in her home through which to send emails. This was all suspicious apparently so the FBI decided to investigate every single one of her emails and eventually concluded, yeah, she should've used the government address as she was at risk of being hacked, but since there was no criminal intent behind her actions she can't be reasonably prosecuted. Anyone who says she should be locked up is ignoring the advice of the FBI, so take that into account.



- DNC supporting her over Sanders: Basically what was uncovered were emails from the DNC (Hillary's party, but no emails involved Hillary personally) where staff members were joking about the Sanders campaign and saying he wouldn't get the nomination and stuff... Obviously unprofessional, and as both candidates were Dems they were supposed to be unbiased, but there is no evidence that they influenced the actual electoral process, just that they talked about it behind closed doors. People who were dissatisfied with Sander's nomination failed to take into account that A) the primary system is stupid, but it's always been that way, that doesn't make it ""rigged"" towards Hillary B) Hillary literally received almost four million more votes than Bernie Sanders in the primaries so there is really no dispute about who the nominee should be.

She's interested in fashion, pop music and whatever's popular at the moment (she's a young teenager, though, so perhaps her tastes will change in the future). The best words to describe her would be  cool, quietly confident and calm/collected/composed (whichever you think is the best antonym for anxious, because she's the total opposite of it). On the negative side, she can sometimes be quite petty with her school friends and sometimes might hurt people in a desire to fit in with the crowd.

I spend much more time in my head, I am often anxious and tend to overthink everything I do or say. I appreciate art very much but I am not good at it at all, I much prefer writing over drawing. I like reading, which she doesn't (except for comic books). When I was her age, I was much more interested in studies, I genuinely liked studying (still do), she's much more interested in activities outside of the school(she has done gymnastics, hip-hop dancing, drawing, sung in a choir etc.). I am very reserved, and although people generally seem to like me after they get to know me, the fact that I often overthink every human interaction sometimes makes me anxious that everybody hates me (although rationally I understand that this is not the case, as people have assured me that they like me numerous times). 

We get along very well, the only annoyances we have with each other is her sometimes seeming petty or overly harsh, and her seeing me as a huge softy and a bit of a weirdo.",INFP,329,1855,mbti

1639507,"#OH LORD I FEEL YOU SO MUCH! 

I am famous for being able to continue sleeping despite any sort of alarms, including those huge ass old school sub woofers blaring shit like slipknot. I now wake up consistently at 6:00 in the morning. Here's my methods and logic-

**Alarms**
Ok I'm sure you have one. That is not enough. Get multiple ones, and set them for varying times and place them in different spots in your room. Down load apps that force you to do math problems, captcha, matching, things like that. I use *I Can't Wake Up* and it's delightful. Set up ALL the phones with an app like this, at least at first. DO NOT USE SONGS, use unpleasant noises like a rooster crowing. I would also suggest checking out one of those REM alarms as well. 

**Hydrate**
Drink a cup of water right before bed, this will cause you to have to go to the bathroom in the morning and so you'll be forced to get out of bed. Also when you first wake up, chug a glass of water. Being dehydrated makes you feel that weighted down sort of tired. I do this along with...

**Caffeine**
Some people will waggle they're finger at me for this one, but they are the same people who don't understand the struggle. First thing I do after I turn off my first alarm, is chug a glass of water and take a caffeine pill. Then promptly sleep for another 15 minutes. By time that second alarm goes off, the caffeine is hitting my system and I feel awake and ready to go. Like drinking coffee with out having to get up and make the coffee and no unneeded calories from dubious amounts of creamer I would have used! I will defend this method till I'm black and blue, so haters can come at me all they want!

**Lights**
Lighting affects (or effects, I can never remember how to use them properly) your meltonin production and circadian rhythm if my memory of science mumbo-jumbo serves me correct. So, in the morning, turn on all the lights! Lie to your body and trick it into thinking that it should naturally be up at that ungodly hour. On the flip side, in the evening turn the lights off and avoid blue light. Get one of those blue filter apps for your phone, and when you go to sleep throw on a face mask to eliminate any light (I've noticed my sleep is a lot better quality since I started using a face mask, but clean it regularly so you don't start breaking out like a teenager with a pizza addiction). Side note, you can take melitonin to help induce sleep. It's different from normal sleep sedatives, I suggest looking into getting yourself some!

**Bedtime**
THIS WAS THE WORSE! Why stop doing things I'm enjoying doing, when I obviously have the energy to do it, to lay in bed and toss and turn for the next four hours?! Because your body works better on a schedule, and while it's a bitch to get it on a schedule its so much easier in the long run. Occasionally you even get to be one of those magical people who falls asleep in ten minutes! 

**Exercise**
This one might seem obvious, but being physically tuckered out will help you fall asleep. Plus you get tones of endorphin's, and all types of other goodies too.

**Meditation**
HEAR ME OUT! I don't know about you, but at night when I'm like ""ok, it's bedtime!"", my brain is all like ""braj, you funny! It's a perfect time to think about that obscure thing that makes you cringe but no one else noticed!"". I've allowed my brain to have free range of my thoughts for many many sleepless nights, but no more.  Bed time is not a time for day dreams, its a time for sleep, and meditations works out your resistance to giving into these thoughts. Your brain is like a muscle and it needs exercise too. Try out of of those body relaxing ones when you lay down to go to sleep, they make you feel all tingly and if you are the least bit tired you will knock out. But please do not knock this until you try it, it make be a little difficult at first but you're new, and what new thing isn't a little difficult. Unless you're one of those people who picks up things with ease, in which case I hope you step on a Lego, which is totally not coming from a place of envy.... 

I apologize for my ranty rambles, I'm procrastinating from doing what I should actually be doing. Good luck with the waking up!",INFP,794,4220,infp
1006414,"1) I draw. I use to do it all the time when I was younger, and I honestly don’t know when it started, but I kinda stopped for whatever reason and I’ve only recently picked it back up in the last few months.

2) I LOVE to read. I just love getting immersed into all the complex and interesting worlds that people are able to create inside their heads, and it can also help me to forget about any problems I have for a little while.

3) My favorite thing to do with my friends is probably just talk. One of my friends and I have these really long and sort of philosophical discussions where we just talk about hypothetical situations a lot and it drives our other friends crazy because they have no idea what we’re talking about. They get so confused that you’d almost think we were speaking in a different language or something lol.

4) Outside of school there’s not really any one specific topic that I’m learning about. I just kinda look into whatever seems most interesting at the time.

5) Some of my favorites are Your Name, Howl’s Moving Castle, and Donnie Darko. I just love everything about those movies, but I don’t really know how to describe what their meanings are to me.

6) My favorite genre is Alternative Rock, but I’m also a sucker for pretty much anything with acoustic guitars. I guess I just really like the way they sound.

7) Yes, but not in every mood. I have playlists on spotify for when I’m feeling particularly happy or sad, and one for everything else.

8) My room doesn’t really have a uniform style I don’t think. In terms of expressing what I like, I do have a map of Middle-Earth on my wall and a few Star Wars themed items though.

&gt;* **Therapy Thursday**: I see theme days used well on other subs. Therapy Thursday could be a stickied post posted every Thursday morning where people are encouraged to vent about problems they’re personally experiencing as introverts, to which the /r/introvert community can suggest solutions or ideas or point them towards help. If it worked, this could help soak up some of this from the main page.
* **Weekly Q&amp;A**: Another regular post. It could be posted on a Monday and kept stickied for the rest of the week. It could be a chance for people to ask questions that might otherwise seem silly or repetitive like ‘What is an introvert?’, ‘What is the difference between introversion and shyness?’, etc.
* **Introvert of the Month**: I think this could be a good way of celebrating introversion, rather than complaining about things. It would be a post that the mods could sticky for the duration of the month, profiling a celebrated successful fellow introvert. For example: Barack Obama, JK Rowling, Bill Gates, Emma Watson, Rosa Parks, Angela Merkel. It could include a brief bio, some discussion of why they are considered introverts and how this may have helped them succeed, some quotes by/about them as introverts, and links to more reading. This would need a bit of work and some research, so I’ve suggested only doing this monthly. But, if people like the idea, I would be happy to get the ball rolling with the first of these.

1784333,"Sorry to say I don't remember where I got this (I had it pasted into Evernote), but hopefully this may help you differentiate the functions:

[P]e

Se (Extraverted Sensing) provides data about the individual’s immediate surroundings. This can take the form of immersion in the environment and acute perception of details. It also provides data on the person’s orientation/location in space and helps the individual deal with novel concrete problems in an improvisational manner.

Ne (Extraverted Intuition) imagines new possibilities in the external world and detects patterns to generate new ideas. This may take the form of brainstorming, creativity or synthesis of new ideas. It works by making connections between ideas that may seem random or unrealistic to others.


[J]e

Te (Extraverted Thinking) creates strategies and makes decisions based on effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and other objective measures of performance. It is pragmatic and is useful for planning, logistics, time/resource management and other tasks that require “real world” problem solving. It validates its decisions based on empirical data and quantitative measurements and constantly searches for areas of improvement.

Fe (Extraverted Feeling) makes decisions based on values and their pragmatic consequences on people. It primarily deals with creating social harmony and adjusting attitudes and behaviors to assimilate into one’s social environment. It works in a similar fashion to Te, except it asks “Is this acceptable?” instead of “Does it work?”. It manifests itself in social graces, politeness and sensitivity towards others’ feelings.


[P]i

Si (Introverted Sensing) works by comparing new data against an internal archive of sensory experiences, feelings, data, facts and forms. It works by routinizing, preserving, reflecting and trusting what is known. It differs from Se because it constructs subjective forms of absorbed information instead of using raw sensory stimuli. It focuses on a single aspect of sensory experience (for example, sight) and takes a very detailed snapshot which is accurately stored and retrieved when a similar stimuli is encountered.

Ni (Introverted Intuition) is primarily an unconscious process and surfaces with solutions to novel problems and insights. It works by abstracting and extracting symbolic meaning from everyday experience and combining it with archetypes and learned patterns to provide insight and “meaning”. It can be described as a peripheral perception device. Unlike Ne, it is not driven by interest in novelty or mere curiosity but with searching for universal truths underlying common experience.


[J]i

Ti (Introverted Thinking) is a subjective judging function which works by evaluating ideas based on consistency, logical correctness, and comparing them against an internal framework of principles. It is mainly concerned with how things work and strives to find internal consistency and avoid self-contradiction, infinite regresses and other logical pitfalls. It is a conscious linear process that follows a straight line of reasoning. It is analytical and works by dissecting ideas and systems into smaller components and providing a detailed explanation of the underlying processes and sub-processes.

Fi (Introverted Feeling) makes value judgments based on an internal set of values and strong sense of personal identity. It mainly works with subjective ideals and values and makes judgments based on resemblance and compatibility. It is attracted to ideas and evaluates them based on intangible phenomenon. Unlike Ti, it cannot easily articulate itself because it works by harmonizing feeling tones instead of forming a verbal narrative. It is used for making judgments about moral and aesthetic worth.

I don't see a way that you can win, and by win I mean end up in a romantic relationship with your ENTJ friend.  Your sexual orientations are unfortunately incompatible, and no amount of Ni obsession and synthesizing will change that fact.  So moving forward you have to decide whether you can accept her as just a friend or if that will never be enough.  Hopefully it's the former, I find it incredibly hard to make and keep good friendships.

We need stress. Stress is our fuel. We live for stress.

I think the problem with you is distress and not stress. Stress is caused by a solvable problem (like having to write an essay that's due tomorrow). Distress on the other hand is caused by an unsolvable problem, an inability to cope with stress (like not having enough money to get by and there's no solution in the near future). All you can do is just sit there feeling like shit, listening to the voice in your head reminding you of all your problems.
 
So, if you can solve your problems, solve them, otherwise seek help from close people. Meditation won't help you lower stress, only solving your problems will.

If you think you're smarter than 90% of people, you may have to start presenting test results and statistics. If you say you're above average, you're probably right.

My point is, that doesn't really mean much. Most people will say ""it's what you do with it,"" and that's true. But my primary point (voiced in strong terms, because smart people need to start doing a better job of grasping it) is that there is no better or worse way to spend time, or even to spend a life.

You can spend your time looking down upon people you think are less intelligent than you, and that's your right, but for somebody who cares about wasting time and energy, that is the worst possible way to waste time and energy.

Oh it is a lot more scientifically valid than MBTI for these are things we can actually test for while MBTI is not bad science nor it is good science it is trying to ask and answer questions that science can't test for and thus doesn't realy fall under empircism.

* (Some of the Big Five traits have some loose coorrelation with the letters but key word loose and complicated.)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Why did I bring up the big five you asked?  Lets talk about letter 5 of the Big 5 (OCEAN / CANOE are acronyms meant to help you remember the 5 traits.)

**Neuroticism**

You can be highly neurotic or lowly neurotic (more stable.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Neuroticism

We often think of neuroticism as a bad thing but it is not like that.

Neuroticism has lots of good things and lots of bad things.  Furthermore neuroticism does not determine outcomes (more on this later.)

For example neuroticism has some correlation with insight and intuition (though the other 4 functions also have some correlation with intuition and insight.)

You are better able to tell when something ""does not fit"" and you are more active to look for a solution or a better fit to the thing that does not fit.

Aka with emotions you may seek out a new solution instead of just ""dealing with it"" and suffering.

But with thought problems you may be a person who is more perfectionist and always improving on your thoughts and insights for you realize the limitations of your current way of describing the issue.

Aka neurotic people may find it more easy to enter a negative thought space but they are also more able to think outside of the box and reframe their perspective.

-----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I am having problems explaining this in words.  So I am shifting to a different subject and then hopping to come back to what we were talking about and you can ""grok"" the insight I can't put into words.

In Psychology we have something called ""theory of mind"" and there are 3 aspects of theory of mind.

* Affective

* Cognitive

* Conative

Aka this picture.

http://www.kolbe.com/mKcom/assets/Image/slide-3-parts-mind.jpg

In modern terms this is often called the ABCs of psychology for 1) Affect, 2) Behavior, and 3) Cognition with 2 being the same as Conative but using a more common word for Conative which is Behavior even though this Maslow and other Psychologist have a lot of good explanations why Conative is a better word vs Beahvior for it helps you understand the difference between Cognition and Behavior and Cognition and Conative (those various drives and doing the things the drives tell you).

But yeah sepearting the self and our thoughts into these 3 categories is the key insight of many forms of psychology such as CBT aka this picture.

http://pacificcognitivebehavioraltherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CBT-image.png

&amp;nbsp;

So the goal of many forms of psychology is not to try to stop neuroticism, or your tragic background theory but instead to break down the steps of what you do, into affective, cogntiive, and conative.

Furthermore you can break down affective into more steps such as what are my feelings (under neath it all) vs how I feel about it which is often not feelings but emotions and you are describing emotional and mood states.

Ergo (can't keep on saying the word furthermore) we can break down the Conative into multiple steps like what is my instinct to do when this happens, what is my self regulation energy during this time (am I tired, am I stressed, am I recharged), what will be my self regulation and motivational energy after doing this, will the enviroment feedback and give me more energy, what is the reward, is there a support system?

And likewise do the same thing with Cognitive where we can break down things like is this Knowledge or just an Impression, is this something I can educate myself about, can I ask questions of other people, are my beliefs impacting my perspective of viewing the subject, are my beliefs the same as my knowledge or another lense on top of what I truely know.

By compartmenalizing our thought process and doing things one at a time we can be more systematic and be able to channel our natural neurotic energies in a more pro-active way of doing things.  We can also just let some things go when we understand where it comes from.

&amp;nbsp;

A neurotic person will notice a needle in a haystack, and sometimes this is helpful.   But spending too much time in the haystack can cloud our mind.  It is a balance between these things and that is why I brought up the greek stuff earlier.  Harmony and Discord are the same thing they are the alingment of different objects into a new arrangement.  Think music, two or more instruments can blend in together to form a song.  Well how you play those two instruments and moving certain sounds forward or backward in time, which notes you play, the loudness of the notes, and its interplay with its partner vs partners....

All of this can sound like a beautiful harmony or a loud cacophony of Disharmony, Eris, and Strife.

Just nudging one thing, or several small things, can cause the transition from something very pleasant to very unpleasant and back again to pleasant.

A child who is very aware how quickly things can go to hell is not an advantage nor it is a disadvantage. A child who is very oblivious of how things can go to hell or not is not an advantage or disadvantage.  What you would do with these two different children is different.

* One you will teach how to channel this insight, this noticing of patterns, and this fear of things going wrong...you teach them to channel this productively and to just enjoy life with the doing.  You teach them to enjoy life while doing, but also reminding them to passively enjoy life every now and then and just to be despite the fear, the trepidation, and how you can get lost in the arousal state.

* While with the other child you will try to teach them more self awareness and how the self is impacted by the environment and other selves and vice versa and how your actions can transform the environment for good or for ill, and hopefully this child will learn to be proactive while still enjoying life passively.

520038,"There are 2 basic arguments you need to consider when appealing to an INTJ from the outside and be concise in your plea, and what an INTJ may respond to.

1) What exactly is it? 

* It is not a horoscope, it is an explanation of the basic methods of how peoples brains work to create their persona. 

He does not need to study the whole lexicon of MBTI or Jungian typology just the 4 basic dichotomies Ti/Te, Si/Se, Ni/Ne, Fi/Fe. The average INTJ can grasp the concepts and interconnectivity of the functions easily over a weekend. This may however encourage him to learn more about it.

2) How can this be useful to the INTJ?

This one is a tricky one as most INTJs especially those later in life have already developed their own internal typology but more vaguely as it relates to other people. Example: that new guy Bob is just like James, Jerry, Richard, etc... I will deal with them the same way, which can be problematic.  

A possible productive question could be ""How can I prove this to him as a superior method than what he currently uses?""

For me it was a fellow INTJ pointing out that I was most likely an INTJ myself. I considered this guy a bit of an asshole and hard to deal with but overall a good challenging person to converse with. The thought that I myself could be coming off as just as big of an asshole as this guy did strike me, and fairly hard. I had previously openly admitted to people ""Yes, I'm an asshole, that is who I am so deal with it."", however I had not fully grasped how true that statement was. 

I did several tests to cross confirm his assumption and to confirm it for myself. I began to research my type and how it affected others and the effects others had on me. This ultimately has led me to actually attempt to be more compassionate and pay more attention to how I deal with others I care about. 

As a parent INTJ myself I will attempt to give my opinion as to how to best make a logical appeal to emotion. Any irrational emotional appeal will probably get you little ground or potentially lose ground, I would avoid them. Try following a conversation along the lines as follows it may not be perfect as I will make certain assumptions of you and your situation, but first make sure they aren't in deep focus on something before engaging in this conversation.

**YOU:** ""Hey dad remember the time I got upset when you did/said ""X""?""(some situation that caused you to break down emotionally unintentionally and they showed some level of remorse for) 

**Him:** ""Yes,....""

**You:** ""Well, now that I have studied types it has allowed me to fully realize that you were truly sorry and didn't mean to hurt me then and I just wanted you to know I completely forgive you.""

This blatant honesty (if you are honest and have such a situation to draw on) will have a jarring affect as you as their child have intimate access to some of their feelings. At this point the conversation has a lot of divergent possibilities as you potentially just derailed an INTJ, and you will need to stay focused. Your goal is to then produce an explanation as that you feel this can prevent future misunderstandings. You will have to essentially state that you want for a better relationship with them and you have witnessed the value of this tool to do such as your ability for forgiveness of said event not their apology at the time.

Typology can explain why the honest, unsolicited forgiveness from nowhere has such an impact and its' implications. The Ni will automatically extrapolate several possible reasons this came up and assume the most obvious, you were hurt a) more deeply than they thought b)the pain persisted longer than they thought. As mentioned before you are one of a select group who has access to their feelings and produce the conclusion that they were wrong. Since confidence in judgement is central to their Ego it produces stress and alteration of function usage. This opens up emotional appeals, however the INTJ logic is quick to recover and will only hold to those logically presented and will discard any illogical arguments once it recovers.

If they came to, say, a party to have a beer and a laugh, why on god's green earth would they want to have an arguement with a stranger? They don't. They don't want a hard discussion either. They want to laugh and play beerpong. So as soon as you go for ""the serious stuff"" they just play the fool. It feeds your ego (""I can, they can't"" mentality) so you go away or atleast let them go about having a good time without embarassment on their part. Odds are they didn't think about it, but that's the exact course they took. It's the same as when my body builder ""friend"" wants to have an arm wrestle. I just concede, it feeds his ego and gets him off my back.







I don't really think it's fair to stay ""most people are incapable of providing any substantial form of discourse."" because it's unlikely that you have met most people. It's more likely, that the people you have met have little interest in some sort of heated discussion with a stranger. They would much rather laugh and be happy( and I do think it's fair in this instance to say that most poeple would like to be happy).








Personally, when people with a strong mind for reasoning and discussion intentionally bait people without those qaulities into discussion just to beat them, I find it offensive and childish. It is the same in my eyes, as a large kid bullying a small kid. In this instance, the bullying is being done with the brain, not with the body.

1547150,"I am no relationship expert so take everything I say here with a grain of salt. I just spent a year and a half in my first relationship, which has come very late in my life (I'm in my 30's). I was inexperienced to the point where I felt like I needed to experience a relationship no matter what... provided there was a basic physical attraction.

I met a girl, and she wanted to get physical kind of quickly and I was happy to oblige and finally get some experience. However, we had seemingly nothing in common and a few days after we first got physical, she admitted to me that she was on psych meds for bipolar type 2. That and other things always made me feel reserved about our long term prospects and I never developed passionate love for her. However, I did feel immense gratitude and I felt the need to make a serious effort at being with her. I spent a year and a half with her and learned to care for her deeply, but I don't know if I can rightly call that love. Even so, I might have married her if she had been a little more stable. All along I'd just be thinking, ""I'm an INTJ and I'm just not capable of passionate love, but I can do commitment"".

Well, turns out, I'm perfectly capable of that kind of infatuated passionate love as I've discovered since that relationship ended. Now, if I had gotten married and discovered that after the fact, that might lead me into doing the sort of reprehensible things he's doing. If he hasn't damaged the relationship beyond repair at this point, what should probably happen is marriage counseling... that could be tough for an INTJ though. So maybe there is another way.

EDIT: I want to add that he may very well not be having a physical affair. I personally can never imagine doing that under any circumstances... but I would also be telling myself that as long as things didn't get physical (or sexual in any other way), anything I'm doing is fair game.

701976,"I guess the best advice in that circumstance is something that is very core to me: always look for opportunities and do not be afraid to jump on something even if it won't work out.

Anytime something sounds like it could be a good thing for you, it's at least worth checking out up until the point that it starts costing you.  And at that point, **and NOT before that point,** is when you should turn away if you're not sure you want to do it.  So many people I know psych themselves out about potential opportunities before they even give them a shot, they convince themselves that it won't work or it will suck or whatever, and so they never even actually try it because they already ""know"" what is going to happen. 

And that leads to so much failure for them, absolutely 100% certainly more failure than they would have encountered if they actually gave things a shot.

My experience relates: I loaned myself a portion of my savings to start my business.  This is one of about 2 or 3 times in the past 5 years I've had that kind of savings and could have done it, but this time I took the chance and did it.  I learned a lot before I even spent any money; learned enough in fact that I really regretted not taking the plunge and starting my business sooner.  

Basically I took the opportunity of having a job with some extra disposable income, and got in touch with some people who were already in the industry and asked them to mentor me.  They did, and it worked out.

I have failed many times; not in business per se, just life in general.  I've barely scraped by, I've been broke more than a few times.  Most of my friends and peers are regularly telling me how far ahead of people my age I am, how they wish they had the opportunities I have.  But most often, anyone could do what I do - sure, not people living below the poverty level who can't even feed themselves, that's not what we're talking about here though.  Anyone with a minimum wage job and minimal debt can make a few sacrifices to follow my path.  The difference is, I took the opportunities, I took the plunge and TRIED.  I think it's significantly underrated how much making an effort when you want to see something happen can set you apart from the vast majority of others' results.

However, my path is not the only one to follow, it's not the easiest, and it's not the hardest, it's just an example of how allowing yourself to take opportunities as they arise leads to success.  As I said before, my friends see me as lucky.  My response is almost always that I ""make my own luck.""  I'm sure some of them see it as a bullshit response, but it is absolutely true.  I haven't had anything particularly ""lucky"" happen to me... I just make a point of noticing when something could be an opportunity and acting on it.

I will go up to strangers and start talking to them about something if I have some context for doing so.  Ie, at a coffee shop, I happen to hear a guy talking about his ""customers"" and the conversation sounds like one about investment banking.  I might walk up, offer him my hand, introduce myself and tell him that I've been interested in X or Y or Z for a while, and see what he knows about it.  

The cool thing about this is, successful people are ALWAYS networking, you never know when someone you met 4 years ago is going to call you up with an opportunity right up your alley.  So walking up to strangers in public is not actually something that is going to turn most people *who are likely to help you out* off.  If I see a guy with a positive attitude coming up to me and asking me about something, and it's something I can speak intelligently about, I'm very glad to have met that person.

But for most people, this kind of behavior is so far out there that they can't comprehend it.  I am **naturally an introvert.** I have developed this kind of outgoing social behavior in myself simply because it has been necessary, driven by my desire to understand things and experience things in the world.  But once you do it a few times, it gets easier.

TL;DR: talk to people, look for and take opportunities, don't be put off by the effort.  And don't be discouraged by failure.  Use the resources you have available to you, and if you feel like you're not accomplishing much, spend time looking for ways to accomplish more, meet more people, etc.  If you're not employed, your priority should be to get employed, not find a dream job.  If you ARE employed, you should be looking for better jobs and networking among your clients / colleagues.  Never stop thinking of new ways you can be spending your time.  Never stop thinking of things that you are spending time on that you don't want to be / don't need to be.

One last thing.  Your time is valuable.  I pay a house cleaner 35$ an hour to clean my house, because they do it better and faster than I would.  I only consider myself worth about 30$ an hour, but their efficiency and thoroughness is easily above mine.  Obviously don't spend money on things you can't afford, but so many people want to save money by ""doing things themselves"" and that honestly will sometimes cost them more than they save.  Just do the cost-benefit analysis.  I pay 180$ a year to have my car detailed for similar reasons.  In short, I hate cleaning so I don't do a good job.  I let professionals do it, I end up happy with the result and while they do it, I can read / play a game / make a phone call to further my business.

I am happy to continue this conversation, if you have any other questions.

I have a great group of friends that I see regularly and I spend time with when I can (even going on vacations with some of them). As I was growing up, however, I would struggle with this, but I think part of it was finding people that understood and accepted how I am and they were patient with my penchant for being aloof. 

As for relationships? Well, I am horrible with those. Getting really close to people takes me a lot of time (lots of people know me, but not many KNOW me), so I guess I really need to be friends first, until I can feel comfortable and trust them. In the past, I was also often interested in people who are already in relationships (Not healthy, but SAFE). I find myself much more comfortable when I know where I stand. Nothing happened (obviously).

My family is very small and not very close. We do not talk much, and certainly not with honesty.

It is being busy, and doing motor movements without an environmental stimuli, or without an internal reason, but because you feel you are obligated to do so.

Being fake is putting on a false face, a persona (the latin word for persona means theater mask), not to exist in society, but to fill a void for you feel that is your obligation but you are not in touch with your own internal self and your goals and dreams and feelings.  You have no clue what is important to you and that is the core of both introverted feeling and extroverted feeling (Fi and Fe).

&amp;nbsp;

It is a form of vertical splitting (this is a psychology term) where you have two worlds that you have compartmentalized and you can't integrate into one world.  You live not as you should but instead how you think others want you to, but even this is false.  This is a form of bad faith (see next link)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)

It is the definition of bad faith, when society and the individual are at war and society is not healthy but instead just exists due to authority.  A fancy term I do not really like for it is not used in traditional language and is just a word you see in psychology, philosophy, etc is Anomie

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie

Note Anomie does not happen in all societies, it does not happen in societies that are truely organic and have a hierarchy structure where the society adapts.  Instead Anomie exists in authoritarian or other forms of culture where people have power and they want to impart what they see as virtuous and make everyone else live by these standards.  Regardless of the intention, regardless of the goals of this artificial virtue, it does not reflect true reality and the feelings of the individuals of society.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

There may be **order** in Anomie but there is no **true law**.  Now when I say Law I am not referring to rules, but law as an organic thing, law that has legitimacy, utility, validity, it also has the ability to adapt and learn from itself.  Law is the opposite of arbitrary use of power, instead Law has accountability, it applies to everyone.  Laws do not just exist for the people with power or without power (aka they exist for the people of authority and the ones who lack it).  They are clear, they are fair, they are things that can be enacted, administered, and enforced in the real world instead of the world of ideals.  Some people use the term **rule of law** to mean true law instead of arbitrary rules.  The rule of law leads to a more just system than the absence of the rule of law.

Now law besides regulating society also leads to a system where a person can feel the ability of being themselves and live authentically.  One does not need to be fake to thrive in such a society, furthermore one is able to feel not at war with themselves and not at war with society.  Anomie is a state that leads to despair (especially existential despair), depression, anxiety, resentment and a couple other things we consider to be extremely bad emotions / states of being.  Anomie is war that never ends, and where you can not identify your enemies.  The world as a system is your enemy with Anomie but you can't be continuously at war with the world and remain happy and remain the ability to self actualize.  It is a form of purgatory, a form of hell without end.",INTJ,642,3689,ENFP

We will never know the true answer to the problem until we solve the problem... and in this case we can't fathom how the difference in change will be between us/those who stand on that line. Simply put I think it's relates to the idea of concept of god in human perspective, if you notice the defintion always changes with our perspective on what we can control.

In very essence, the escape of the current box is what we define as the current scope of this concept. However the ancients also assumed that the gods were those who could control lightening, fly, and may or may not involve giant hammers that no man could wield. Technologically, I am Thor in this respect as I can honestly make all these technologies. (lazer taser, jetpack, exosuit). 

To tie this back together, I suppose the argument of perspective is ultimately rooted in the thought of ""does god have a god"" and as was ultimately pointed out to me on this reddit at one earlier point ""if so, at which point did he create himself"".

Basically look at the tragectory and the path human understand follows, and that's where this debate begins to become interesting... and to be honest, we can never really know the perspective over this. People have theorized at great length what the future will be like, however in application they are never correct (the jetsons comes to mind immediately as a modern example). 

I think what your looking for though can be found more through looking back for a solution, the evolution of humanity in general is interesting at the evolution of mankind as a race.

I'll take each of these questions in turn, but I'm going to approach this philosophically, since I don't know the psychology of love very well and romanticizing it can lead us all sorts of unsustainable places.

1.) Don't really know my thoughts on love 100%, other than it's a verb. It's not a passive state so much as a series of actions; you show it by doing things for someone else. It's also not permanent; we ultimately choose from moment to moment whether or not someone else's well-being is a higher priority than our own. If we do, we're ""in love."" If we don't, we're not -- and relationships, even (or especially) healthy ones aren't always ""in love"" 100% of the time. Regardless, since love is a sort of light ego-death, the feeling we get from can be pretty transcendent.

2.) Definitely exists. Being in love at least once will answer that one real fast, but it's always a conscious choice or effort on both parties' parts -- we don't just passively find ourselves in some state of love magically. Like anything, love takes practice and a willingness to be in love in the first place.

3.) Doesn't have to be, I suppose. For me personally, I find love really takes up a lot of my emotional head-space (not necessarily in a bad way); I can't imagine that there's anything left to dedicate to another person equitably. But I know people who can be in love romantically and truly with multiple people, and more power to them.

4.) Found it a few times, some more seriously than others. Again, it's ultimately a choice we choose to make (or not) on a daily basis. Romantic love isn't like how people describe divine illumination / enlightenment, where something just ""clicks"" and it's impossible to ""unclick"" from then on out.

5.) It does, particularly if you pride yourself on emotional self-sufficiency. It requires a level of vulnerability that's not normal in most day-to-day life, and it can really be a bummer when it doesn't pan out.

6.) It's mostly lots of little things to let another person know you're thinking about them and care for them; in general, I'd say that I think about the situations they're in and, based on what I know of them and who they are, figure out what would make life easier / better for them. Then I go and do that. Using me purely as an example: if I had a crazy busy day at work and was really stressed, it would mean the world to me if things I needed to do around the apartment were done and my partner just wanted to chill with me and some albums she knows I like. I know I would feel really special, and I guess at the end of the day love is wanting to give that feeling to someone else, in a way that's meaningful for them.",INTP,515,2795,INTP

        int x = 10;
    
        while (x &lt; 9) {x++};  
And children of it could mutate only parts of it:

        double x = 11;
        while ( x &gt; 9) {x++};
        int a; //this could be created by following rules
   
  Rules would be:

 a. Program should compile;

 b. Variables can mutate - change its type, value and etc.

 c. No loops 

 d. Can add some random code to itself

&gt;  Sexual reproduction, building from the source code of two parent programs with possible random permutations is a possibility, but still hard to do right.

Well, I think that sexual reproduction would be ideal. Firstly all the programs would be the same, but after first generation something would be different, some ""genes"" would differ so we could cross those and get a new generation that would be a mix from first. 90% of those probably wouldn't even compile, so uncompilable ones would be regenerated until the whole generation is compilable. Compile and run. Program, which made most processes of its ""kids"" would get promoted, so 50% of the other programs would get crossed with this one. Repeat again and again. Or maybe there should be ""elite"" selection - three best programs get unchanged/not die in next generation. So maybe we would have three types of programs what would be very different and would complement each other. 

&gt; halting problem

What if they could run for 10/20/30 seconds until restart? Every 10 seconds they start from scratch. Program takes too much CPU? It gets killed. Program takes too much RAM? Kill it. After some time they would optimize itselves or maybe they could even find flaws in these restrictions and find a way around them. That is what I want. 

&gt; How do you determine ""best"" precisely?

The one that:

a. Runs for the longest time without crashing

b. Takes more space than others. (In first rounds this wouldn't be an advantage (slower reproduction), but later they could become more complex, their parts of useless code would get specified tasks)

c. I don't know what's more but I know that they are not going to be that big problem because it is a lot easier to think of when environment and 0th generation are created, you know what to rely on.

1422311,"&gt;Why is it illegal to pay for something you can legally give away for free?

I understand your point of view, and I'm not even necessarily arguing that it should be illegal. I will say that prostitutes and sexually promiscuous women have had, have now and will have lower sexual market value on the whole - partially because of their inhibited ability to pair bond. Failure to pair bond results in a greater probability of broken marriage and/or single motherhood. Historically in the west and before the establishment of the welfare state or the invention of birth control, single motherhood was a shameful social position to hold. Single mothers had to rely on either the charity of the church or the financial support of her father to raise her child. It was then especially in the best interests of families to promote and protect the chastity of their daughters through social stigma and law. Whether or not the legal prohibition of prostitution is obsolete is debatable. But the implications of sex are still significant. That is essentially my argument.

&gt;People exchange all kinds of things for sex. It seems to be that only exchanging money with someone who exchanges money with other people is actually illegal.

Yes, non-casual sexual partnership is generally an exchange. The man provides resources and stability while the woman provides sexuality and fertility. On a lizard-brain level, this is what our subconscious desires. The distinction between this animalistic arrangement and prostitution is subtlety and a certain degree of lasting commitment. Why exactly outwardly-expressed social attitudes trend in contempt of this difference is another debatable topic, but I personally believe many people have an intuitive sense that prostitution cheats the mating game. 

&gt;People that are in relationships where sex is a medium of exchange are common. You think Donald Trump's wife would have given him the time of day if he weren't wealthy? She gets access to his money, he gets sex.

Yes, and I believe Melania was said as such in an interview.

&gt;So, it happens all the time but only under certain circumstances is it illegal. It is nonsensical.

Well, I think 1 represents a value of three. So, 1 = 3.

So, then, 1 + 1 = 6.

Of course, I don't actually follow that. But nonetheless, the point I'm trying to make with that is that those symbols used -- assigned the term ""numbers"" by long-dead men -- and what they mean to humans are completely arbitrary. If you set the symbols aside for a bit, there *is* logic underneath. However, I have no reason to believe that said logic is inherently present, and not just a creation of mankind in order to model the physical (physics) and abstract world, and solve problems; and for fun because math is sexy. The logic, mathematics, is a construct of man.

Logic and ethics are human constructs. Or at least, that's what I believe.

&gt; and they trust their logic so finding what makes them happy is extremely hard

INTPs do trust their logic, indeed. I am not suggesting they ignore their logic when finding something that makes them satisfied. I don't think they must go on a pursuit for their life meaning lead by emotion, or at least, lead by emotion more than logic. I am not suggesting that they do what makes them ""happy"" (by the conventional definition). I **am** saying that they should pursue what gives them satisfaction. Satisfaction is not so hard for an INTP; they know very well whether or not they are **content**. If not at an early age, certainly it will come to them with maturation. Even so, satisfaction is not a purely emotional construct; you could very much approach the issue of meaning from a logical viewpoint. For example:

* is what I am doing or planning to do incorporate or compatible with the following: a logical framework, analysis, penchant for accuracy (Ti)
* is what I am doing intellectually stimulating and interesting to me, so that I can keep fairly focused on it for as long as need (Ti + Ne)
* am I doing work that is meaningful to me and allows me to explore the many facets of the world (Ne + Fe)
* am I doing something that does not become routine, mundane, or boring after some time (Ne)

Everyone hits a certain point of being pragmatic about whatever they believe in.

It all comes back to what kind of person you want to be; the one that tries to treat all life with equal respect, or the one that categorizes life with less-to-more-value.  

Your friend is a perfect example of trying to rationalize life in a less-to-more-value. She says that her dog is innocent and thus have greater value. Look at how consistent she is what that logic. If her dog is innocent, then she can not eat animals, because they are all innocent life, she can not feed her dog with innocent life, and so forth.

943220,"**Question 1**

*How do you identify yourself, demographically speaking? Be as vague or specific as you want. (The only requirement is you must tell me your age because I find this to be a highly influencial factor in how confident I feel about typing you.)*

27, M, Filipino ethnicity but American born and raised my whole life, Straight

**Question 2**

*What type do you think you are? Why do you think you are this type? If you do not know your type, why do you think that is? Be as specific as possible.*

ISFJ. 

I'm Si as fuck. For a while I wasn't sure with ISFJ or ISTJ but I did a function type analysis on myself.

Si - A lot of my current favorite video games are from series I played when I was a kid (Nintendo and JRPG) and it takes me a lot to try a new genre. I'm very conservative with spending and I keep track of how much money I spend and always try to find ways to spend less and save more. I'm big on having a eating/drinking routine, in particular I almost always make the same smoothie every morning for breakfast. I usually don't like abstract / what if talks. If it's something that can't be applied that could potentially be related to or done on a physical level I just dont even bother taking part of discussions. A lot of decisions I make tend to be present/past oriented and Im not always good at making or thinking about future goals.

Fe - In general I really try to avoid conflict as much as possible, even if I really want to argue something I'm afraid I may hurt someone feelings by potentially getting too heated in an argument. Before making big decisions I like to consult with at least 1 person I'm comfortable with the topic about. When trying new games/hobbies I try to make sure I know people or good communities already exist and really want to be a big part of them.

Ti- I really like to be overly precise in how I say things to a point to where I screw up, I make sure to back up and say what I mean as accurately as possible. If I'm comfortable enough with someone, I'll try to correct any slight mispronunciation or details they said incorrectly. I like to analyze why people tend to like/dislike things or do certain actions and make my own conclusions. I usually try to bring some degree of logic to discussions, even if it's just my own personal thoughts and analysis on things.

Ne - When I'm stressed I always think of how everything went wrong or all the different ways I could have prevented a bad situation. I'm not always the best in intuitively connecting the dots when it comes to some people's actions and what they really mean. Every so once in a while I'll come up with a crazy weird idea given all the stuff I've experienced 

Only reason I still consider ISTJ sometimes is because people tend to notice how logical/smart I am as noticable.. but then some people know me as one of the nicest people they know..

**Question 3**

*What would getting a 100% accurate MBTI type mean to you? Be as specific as possible.*

One less silly meaningless thing to worry about. Whenever there's a subject/hobby I like a lot I can be a bit obsessive of how I go into it but also to make sure what I like and my place in said hobby is correct.

**Question 4**

*If you were given the opportunity to broadcast yourself on video to the entire world for one minute, what would you do with the time?*

Probably just give a speech about how there's so much hate in the world and we should all do a part to reducing unnecessary negativity. Would try to think of practical small examples people can start with.

**Question 5**

**In what ways (if any) are you misunderstood by society?**

I guess by peers/family/etc I'm a LOT more sensitive then I let on. I just hide it to not get unnecessary attention from people taking time out of their life to think about my problems lol. I'd rather get to know other people's opinions/problems

Outside that I think I'm prettty straightforward and easy to understand..

**Question 6**

*What personal life experiences (if any) do you think have had a significant impact on your development?*

Some really awesome friends I've had, online and IRL. Even little compliments and fun things we do together get my self esteem up. For the longest time I was a super quiet guy, part of it was lack of self confidence due to some personal parental issues, changing schools and being afraid to do things when I fail. 

**Question 7**

*There is no specific question here, but it is an opportunity to link videos, pictures, or other things that you think would be helpful in ascertaining your type. It is essentially your chance to say whatever you want or that you think is relevant. Do with it what you will.*

As an ISFJ, I have this feeling like it's my duty to sacrifice my wellbeing for the good of others. This isn't necessarily a bad urge to have, but in some situations it's totally unreasonable to act on it.

For example: if my work partner asks me to take over a project for him, my first inclination is to say yes, even if I am completely overloaded with projects of my own. I also have a friend who will message me at all hours of the day asking me to help her write college papers, and I always feel obligated to help her, even if it's extremely inconvenient for me. She often tries to make me feel guilt for not helping her (in a passive-aggressive sort of way), so in the past I usually caved and helped her.

For example, we played a game called Fun Facts once. Its pretty self-explanatory: everyone writes down a fact about themselves that they think no one would know, and I read them aloud and people have to guess who wrote what. I gave everyone an index card the morning of the staff meeting and told them the rules, so they would have all day to think of their fact instead of being put on the spot at the meeting.

1086051,"Straight male ENTJ here.

First things first, physical attractiveness. While I don't need a supermodel, I would like my mirrors to stat intact. My beauty standards can actually fall pretty low; just be well groomed, not deformed, not super fat (I know, I'm a hypocrite), smile, and have a vagina. A high libido is a plus. Nonexistent libido is a red flag.

Next, I am very much attracted to people of *high intelligence* in general. While I can get along with people of lower intelligence, I tend to at least subconsciously avoid them. We don't tend to have very much in common; I don't like watching sports or clubbing. I'm a (hopefully pleasant) know-it-all and a nerd, so she has to accept and like that.

Next, as a male ENTJ, I suck at empathy (apparently in both directions). I can piece things together, but I really need verbal communication or rational overexpression to let my sympathy kick in. I think that may be why male ENTJs like SFs, they make it easy to read their emotions. This tends to work best within the TeFi axis.

1. I am a perfectionist/high achiever. I feel my work is a reflection of me. Therefore, I must feel good about my work to feel good about myself. This means double or triple checking stuff I KNOW is correct.

While sometimes I do the things you listed... they are never for their own sake, and never primarily have myself in mind when I'm doing it.

There's so much to appreciate about him, but right now, I'll narrow it down to a few.


- **His kindness and warmth.** He's by far one of the kindest people I've ever met. His sensitivity is just awesome, and I never have to worry about him hurting my feelings, because he's so gentle. 


- **He takes care of me.** I'm so used to running after other people to take care of them, it's so nice to be with someone who reciprocates like he does. If I'm not feeling well, he does everything he can to make me feel better. He's always checking up on me to see if I'm warm, fed, comfortable, etc.


- **His attention to detail and appearance.** He knows how to dress himself well, and he always looks fantastic. Most guys I've known haven't put a ton of effort into their clothing/appearance, but he does. All of his clothes are properly fitted, and they look really good on him. His haircut is always impeccable, and he cares a lot about his hygiene. He always smells so good, and he has better grooming habits than any guy I've ever met.


- **His goofy side.** He makes me laugh so hard. When he's around strangers, acquaintances, and even friends, he's much more reserved, quiet and polite, but when I'm alone with him, he's hilarious. He cracks cheesy jokes, he'll bust out some dance moves, he makes weird facial expressions or noises, and he'll do just about anything to make me laugh. It feels really special to me that I get to see that side of him, and other people don't.


- **His honesty.** He surprises me sometimes with how forthcoming and shameless he is with information. I know that if I ask him something, I'll always get the truth, albeit in a gentler way than I might from other people.

But to summarize, the dichotomy MBTI test does have a strong correlation to Big 5. Functional approaches, not so much. It's how I could test as an INTP so frequently, and score as an RCUEI (I think?) so consistently. 

I know an ESFP very well who would have to be an ENTP if you apply the correlations to a functional approach. Can think of countless others with substantial mismatches. 

Just a guess: Many (functional) ISFJs will score high on openness to experience due to 1) the pleasure seeking nature of Si; and 2) general Pi dom things.

I'm an atheist myself. Religion was never a part of my childhood though. In school, I'd play along and pretend to believe in God because all the other kids would go to church. My older brother is an atheist as well, and I remember him talking about it when I was like 10-11, but it didn't mean anything to me then. 

I can relate to the apathy. But since I'm in the Bible Belt, it's kind of hard to not notice that I'm the only one who seems to just not care about religion. I might offend some people by saying this, but it's just outdated and I don't find a practical use for it in modern society. So that's basically why I'm an atheist. ",ISFJ,160,842,mbti

288883,"I don't think all of this is necessarily true, since perceiving functions are IMO a very much passive thing, which makes them so hard to type for me as well. Functions in general only really describe how someone comes to a conclusion, but they might arrive at the same conclusions in the end, even in the paper clip exercise. A Si user might look at the clip and remember what uses they've seen before or what they internally regard a good use when observing it That may or may not be a practical use. Maybe the person knows someone who makes funny sculptures out of paper clips. Then one of their first thoughts might be ""oh, you can make sculptures out of them"". Then the Judging functions decide whether or not that's a good thing to write down.

The same goes for the purple prose vs. YA fiction example. All of the perceiving functions can lie behind a literary writing style. Si might lead to unique sensory associations that only the writer would make (""the inside of the car carried the scent of a break-up"" - weird, but if the writer associates car smells with a bad relationship, a metaphor that makes sense to them). Ne might make metaphors that are more universally traceable. I don't know if this is a good example, but I remember someone in an AskReddit thread describing the sound of a fax machine as ""Wall-E being waterboarded"". It's a bit of a weird connection, but everyone can kind of imagine what that sound is. Ni is all about getting to the core or an essence of things, so a Ni using writer might display that by being able to portray a character's soul crushing loneliness precisely by describing the way a flock of crows fly by during a scene. A Se user might be very good at describing the way someone gets goosebumps in a scary situation, the sound someone's shoes make on a muddy forest floor, the comforting warmth of the protagonist hugging their cat...

I now am 21 and know a lot of great people who smoke weed and the world kind of changes when you realize just how many people smoke in such a small distance and how relatively normal it has become (although most parents still don't like to hear about it).

1647630,"&gt;I tried to describe Ni as basically as possible since the longer and more personal explanations seem to be ""empty words"" to WhatINeverSaid.

I don't have a problem with personal explanations in theory, but when people describe functions using their personal experiences it is 95% no good. Even SPs describing Se doesn't usually make sense. The functions and functional definitions are abstractions of what is going on in our heads; we use functional definitions because the stuff going on in our mind is too confusing (otherwise we wouldn't even have to define cognitive functions).

&gt;Ni is great with shifting perspectives.

Totally, that is one of the best things you'll see with Ni. Dan Carlin (pretty sure he's ISTP) does a great description of it in one of his history podcasts. I wish I could cite which one, but he talks about how every once in a while, while studying history, he will flash into the perspective of different players in history. [Another example, on a random MBTI channel, that I actually think is a perfect example of Ni use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy10SsipBaU).

Ne and Ni are both good at looking at things from a different perspective, but because Ni isn't limited by objectivity, the Ni user can gain impressions from their projections of what other people are thinking/feeling. INFPs and INFJs are both known for reading people, but it is very different. INFPs are more analytical, Fi and Ne working together to break down a person's possible motivations and feelings. INFJs view a person's behavior (Se) and form an impression with Ni. The impression comes from years of unconsciously observing behavior (Si works in the same way). That impression is then analyzed with Fe, which mainly decides whether the INFJ should act on their impression or not.

730880,"Te users are great storytellers and gossipers. Ne users are great supporting an already moving conversation. Fe users ask questions and keep conversations going, show real care for their friends. Se users will give the most animated responses and can be trusted to take action based on the conversation.

Edit:

I work with teenagers and I can give more concrete examples.

The Te user of the biggest clique is the organizer of the group. The other girls gravitate towards her and she sort of leads the discussion. If she doesn't want to talk about something the group usually won't talk about it. 

The Fe user of the group counters the Te user's coldness and shows concern for the other kids. She asks questions, supports their feelings, and is almost always very agreeable. 

The Se user will get in really close and use a lot of physical touch with her friends. When one of the kids is having a problem that cannot be solved with normal children-politics I can trust her to come to me or another one of the staff for help. Otherwise she will start confrontations with kids that give her friends trouble. 

I haven't typed any of those kids as Ne-doms, but they do have an Ne-dom boy that they bring into their conversations.

In some hypothetical where enough Muslims are imported into the US that they take over and start actively persecuting Christians, then okay, I'll listen to Christians talk about how oppressed they are. But right now this is just a bunch of chicken little-ing over less than 1% of the US population.

Besides, all this talk about the ""war on Christianity"" has been going on wayyyy longer than the refugee crisis. Like since the 80s, at least.

Visual Novels are my favorite genre at the moment but I also like those adventure games like Heavy Rain and The Walking Dead Telltale.

Because Fe is extroverted, it deals with objective realities, and the only objective reality there is as far as feeling is concerned is the feeling of the group. Not only do Fe-users move towards service of the group, but they can be quite pushy about others doing the same.

Fi is the opposite, it deals with subjective realities, and because Fi-users are able to process their emotions internally without external reference they can imagine what others might be feeling, and therefore a mature Fi user is more likely to be happy with disharmony because they recognize people see things different ways, and just as he has a right to see things how he wants, so do others.

It might not be immediately obvious, but actually, the concept of human rights comes out of an Fi mindset. It's a little counter-intuitive but individual rights requires the mindset of people think differently, people feel differently, and even those people harmful to society should be protected.

Whereas an Fe user can be pretty ruthless if they determine that there are individuals or traits that are a risk to the general population. They would be totally happy to go on a witch hunt.

Right now I remember a man saying ""I just remembered, today is my birthday"" but I can't for the life of me figure out where I heard that before.

680888,"ISFJs are extremely concrete and practical thinkers (we dislike dealing with theoreticals, such as those that would appear in debate), and we dislike any type of conflict between people (Si/Fe), even if we know it's an impersonal debate. So debate and theoretical discussions can make us uncomfortable and we'd prefer to just hang out and have friendly conversation instead.

Humor style is different for all ISFJs, of course, but my humor style is a very dry, sardonic, and sarcastic one. There's a bit of wordplay and deadpan in there, too. With Si and Fe, though, sometimes we might try to conform to other people's humor styles while in a group, thus suppressing our own humor style, so as to not create conflict. We also love memes.

I'll link you to this thread on r/isfj: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/4ibg55/do_you_like_to_talk_about_emotions/

ISFJs are not at all open with our emotions. Again due to Si and Fe, we don't want to bring our emotions onto other people so as to not bother, bore, or sadden them. This can be a problem, especially for ISFJs with depression like me or when we're stuck in Si-Ti or Ne loops where we desperately need someone to listen to us vent. Often, we will only talk about our deep emotions with very close friends we mutually respect and trust.

As for why not, my guess is it's because going home with a man you don't know is always a little risky, and because it isn't likely to be a satisfying experience. As a woman it takes a few times with a new partner to find your groove and relax and enjoy yourself, so a ONS is likely to be underwhelming.

One thing that helped me understand intuition is to compare Ne and Ni. Ne is extrapolation, and Ni is interpolation. Ne takes concrete information and speculates on possibilities that can arise from it.

1765848,"Like I said before, the bullshit was mostly about Fe having to do more with social niceties and overt displays of goodwill than simply extraverting your own values while being conscious of how they'll be received based on collective values. Once I internalized that dom/aux Fe aren't character traits or social superpowers, it became easy to recognize how comfortable I am expressing value judgments in conversation, especially trivial ones. 

In my mind, the Ti voice seems the strongest. But after sorting out the aforementioned bullshit and becoming more aware of how I casually speak, it was obvious that as soon as I open my mouth, the Ti becomes shrouded in a calculation between my own subjective evaluation of the 'fact' vs the probable reception. Total unconscious filter. 

Again, the strength of Fe has nothing to do with innate goodwill or social skill, non FJ types aren't innately at a disadvantage there. I realized I was an FJ because of my impulse to state my evaluation of perceived facts, plus a preoccupation with how it'll be received. It's a calculation I don't see TPs jumping to by default. And Fe can totally be used to cause a socially awkward shitstorm. The difference from Fe stereotypes and TP's in my experience is that it's more calculated.",ISFJ,214,1271,mbti

However, these two teachers were so bad at their jobs I made it a point to be a class clown to show how unseriously I took the class (I still did my work)

My theater teacher was terrible at discipline and she always went off topic from theater lectures to talk about things like politics. Her actual teaching theater was fine but she was a pushover it got me mad because I was hoping to use theater as a way to get over shyness but I just got so angry at how the teacher just used class to do what she felt like and was a pushover so I had no respect.

Simiarlly, for calculs teacher I had, he was VERY VERY VERY bad at teaching. Calculus is a hard topic and almost everyone was failing because the teacher wasn't helpful and he was a pushover in terms of people misheaving in class. I had to get a tutor because I could't even ask him for help without him being bad and kind of an asshole too.",ISFJ,224,1154,isfj
1333326,"As an ISFJ, I'll admit that I am a little offended. I personally don't think it sucks that my personality is one that many people seek out to be friends with. I'm someone a lot of people look up to and I get along with almost any one. I am reliable and trustworthy, well liked, and am *shocker* actually a fun person to be around. I live a pretty satisfying life. I'm actually quite proud of who I am and the relationships I can maintain. My INTP best friend, on the other hand, can't hold friendships to save her life (minus myself and my twin ISFJ sister). But she really doesn't care. Relationships are not important to her. So it works both ways. I guess we all have things that are more important to us. For myself, I view my personal relationships as a very important quality in my life. For others, that doesn't matter as much. I guess as long as we are all happy.... No personality is better. I think I went off on a rabbit trail here. Just venting. 

EDIT: And I just have to say, because people compare ISTJ's and ISFJ's so much, that all ISTJ's that I know are actually the hardest people for me to get a long with. The T and the F make a huge difference, trust me. I get irritated with the constant comparisons! ",ISFJ,233,1224,mbti

718644,"An ISFJ will generally not pry deeper unless you stoke their curiosity or seem to be someone they should probably get to know if they're hanging out with you regularly, or unless you engage them on something they're interested in. Si-dom almost certainly has a few pet interests that shouldn't be too hard to figure out if you know much about them at all. If you share that interest in any way, ask them questions about it or show curiosity about it, chances are they love to talk about it, especially if it's not personal/emotional.

And when I say pet interest I mean.. VERY specific. I have to remember to say that to other types. It's not usually ""I'm into video games, all video games!"" It will typically be ""I'm into these 4 video games, and I have played them for ten years."" I still regularly play Civilization II (from 1995!), and also Mario Kart Double Dash (from 2003!) with an ESFJ and ISFJ friend of mine. It's not ""I'm into all music!"", it's ""I'm into these two or three genres, and within those genres I specifically love these 10 bands."" This is why others often find us boring.

I'm not gonna lie, ISFJ and ISTP are pretty tough friendship matches unless there's a really strong shared interest or are being facilitated by an E in some way. Both types tend to be pretty reserved and don't make the first move. Until they warm up to you, if you really want to be their friend, you might have to do a lot of the heavy lifting. And yes, if they just aren't feeling it, they will probably default to not responding rather than giving you closure or telling you directly that they're not interested. It's a bad habit that Si-doms subconsciously judge others as superficial or not in touch with themselves if they don't see something interesting going on under the surface. You can tell if the ISFJ seems really tied to polite, warm, friendly, smalltalk mode that he's probably not thinking there's much to you.

[Here's an article](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/heres-how-to-attract-each-myers-briggs-personality-type/) that should illustrate what I mean.

&gt; Here’s How To Attract Each Myers-Briggs Personality Type

&gt; ISTP: Infiltrate their social circle, see them regularly, match their level of nonchalance and then put sex on the table.

&gt; ISFJ: Act like a superhero, but one who needs to be taken care of. They’ll jump at the chance to nurture your reckless spirit.

Acting like an exciting, alluring superhero who needs certain support is not very typical for an ISTP, and an ISFJ is not likely to try to infiltrate your life, and they probably won't be very intrigued by your nonchalance.",ISFJ,449,2634,isfj

1093155,"&gt; The main thing that MBTI says is that people have preferences as to whether they use each cognitive function in association with introspection or not (and these preferences happen to be less easily measurable than for instance just 'extraversion').

The existence of cognitive functions is just as substantiated as the existence of a resurrected Christ.

If MBTI only talked about dichotomies you could have a more scientific claim, but once again you have to look at Big 5 for those sorts of scales.

&gt;For you not to agree that something like the above is a more well formed concept than for example 'Jesus died for our sins' is irresponsible.

We are talking about differences in scale versus differences in kind. Osmosis is a scientific theory, String theory is a scientific theory. They are the same *kind*, but on a much bigger scale. Christianity is an abstract truth, MBTI is an abstract truth. They are the same kind (and a different kind from scientific theory), but Christianity exists on a much larger scale.

It should also be noted that cognitive function theory is just one small part to Jungian thought, and when Jung's work it taken as a whole it is at a similar scale to Christianity (just like the discussion of the Seven Deadly Sins is just one small element to Catholicism).",ISFJ,223,1302,mbti

1648136,"Has anyone ever told you that you look concerned or worried (your facial expression) a lot? Or do people mistakenly believe that you dislike everyone and don't care about them?

INTJ and INFJ are very different in outward mannerism. Consider someone not a friend, but a friendly acquaintance. INFJ has a very obvious warmth and caring nature towards other people, and even to someone who is just a friendly acquaintance, they are willing to go out of their way to be warm and welcoming. Its not that INFJ wants to be best friends with everyone, but they are very thoughtful and consider it a principle to be warm and kind to people. 

INTJ is a lot more distant, they tend to hold that person at a strict arm's distance so to speak, until the person becomes someone they trust. This is difficult to get to, and only then an INTJ will show genuine warmth and care. Its extremely hard to get an INTJ to exhibit INFJ levels of warmth and genuine care for someone that they actually don't know or care about very much. If you are an INTJ, being forced to appear warm and caring to someone you're not close to might feel like pulling teeth, because your actions don't actually reflect what you feel towards that person inside (Fi). INFJ might not actually enjoy doing it either, but they will put personal feelings aside to do what they hold as a principle (Fe).

Eventually I realize they don't craft in Fi-Se which is so weird for us to think since it's so natural. What helped was to understand the singularity of things.

I often think INFJs are the real artists, because they produce real original ideas, which was confusing to me. How can they come with these never seen before stuff if they don't see the craft? Well their mind works like a starfish, connecting different ideas into one single singularity. But there are no Fi elements to it, they absorb and put together. That's why I find them so precious and beautiful. They are the eternal originality. I just happen to be very good at reading it.

Where we are good at art is through our observations, like a photograph waiting for that good shot. There's a tree in front of your house that you see every day when going outside. Si users see it perfectly, seeing it very clearly because of the daily reminder. The ISFP see the tree differentely, we have all these shots of it from different angles, none of it really marks us more then that. Until we see it in that particular angle that evocate something different. A common singularity that is hidden in the myst of things. We'll try and reach a certain purity of perspective, like a dog following a trail. It's values put together showing us a particular motion that we seek to perfect or to show as its most pure form.

In fact the only time I have ever heard that intuitives and sensors are supposedly so different is when it see rants like this. I'm not discounting their problems (I can even relate to them because I have always felt disconnected to my own family) but I'm simply questioning the reason for the divide. 

As for your last point, MBTI is a huge oversimplification of Jung's work. According to Jung there are 4 perception functions (extraverted and introverted sensing and intuition). An introverted intuitive user is going to have more in common with an extraverted sensor user than they are with an extraverted intuitive. This is because Se works with Ni and Ni works with Se. Understanding the functions is a lot better than looking at the N/S divide if you want to understand differences be people.

210078,"INTP

My reasoning:

1) it has to be a j-dom, because N-doms aren't generally aware of their sensing (so INTP, INFP, ENTJ, ENFJ)

2) thinking is closer to sensing than is feeling--both thinking and sensing are explicit, ie rooted in the conscious mind (so INTP, ENTJ)

3) Si is more intensive than Se. It's also more subjective, implying that it stays truer to the actual nature of sensation. Se has to sift out the unimportant bits to come to an actionable conclusion, Si takes it all in and brings everything into line.",ISFP,92,521,mbti

521212,"Could be, depends what you mean by good with emotion. Fe is very smooth with social situations and dynamic feelings but Fi is better oriented towards personal feelings and values, passion, energy, drive etc. My ESFJ friend always wins at games that involve persuasion and trading like Risk/Monopoly because he leverages the dynamic emotions of that moment to make people want to go along with him, hes also very expressive. However when you pressure him on how he actually feels about things it starts to get muddied because he ignores Fi. Me on the other hand (an SFP) can come off as cold or unfeeling, or maybe just harsh and caustic by showing my Se, if depending on the context and if I dont open up to people even though this isnt my true nature, because Fi is only expressed indirectly through words and actions. However when I do speak about emotionally charged things, its much more impassioned and from the heart so to speak because Fi wants to do something because it believes in it wholly to be the right thing to do, thats why ESFPs often appear as motivational figures on a personal level (most self help authors are this type, and  a lot of movie hero's in cases where they are fighting some sort of evil or oppression) 

ESTPs can have problems with apathy and not seeing the point of anything to a point at which ESFPs would be disturbed because its like do you not FEEL anything, if theres nothing to fight for then why are you living. This is where you get tropes like that drunk pirate from treasure island or Haymitch from Hunger Games, a lot of those old drunk guys that think life is stupid and everyone is stupid are STPs.

Don't feel guilty about missing him either, even if it was a month ago I'd still consider the breakup to be kinda fresh.  Practically anything he says at this point might make you hopeful.

As for my situation, haha, well I don't really want you to follow my example since I did some really stupid things!  I think I initiated that ""let's get back together"" conversation like 5 or 6 times before I decided being friends was *not* working.  Just hanging out occasionally was enough to set me off on some sort of path of intense hoping and over thinking.  Also the whole experience did some really shitty things to my self esteem because I thought I wasn't good enough. (which is not true!)  He wasn't hurt by me cutting things off since he already felt like a huge jerkwad for dumping me and wanted me to do whatever I needed to do.

I made a lot of new friends and had a ton of interesting experiences.  Basically recreating my identity separate from him because sometimes you lose yourself a little in relationships.  Though you seem to be doing pretty good in that aspect, so good on you!  Around 6 months later I reconnected with him as friends.  I wasn't fully over him but I decided it wasn't going to devastate me and I was still keeping my options open with other guys I was interested in.  We were friends for a few months, I made it fairly obvious I was still interested and the friendship started to get really intense.  Like I said, I lucked out since he was coming to a realization that being successful and a good boyfriend isn't mutually exclusive.  Basically, he matured a bit I suppose and I had some lucky timing to be there when it happened.

We didn't really get back together immediately since he didn't want to make a mistake and I was understandably cautious after being rejected 6 times.  It took us awhile to work things about before dating again, but he's a more attentive boyfriend this time around. We had some bumps but try #2 is still going 3 years later.

That said, I have no idea if things will work out that way for either of you!  You can't really count on him figuring out his priorities in your favor.  You could try helping him along by telling him he doesn't need to sacrifice his career to have a loving relationship, but its likely it won't hit home until he figures it out himself.  There's no real guarantee if you're the one he chooses when he comes to that realization either.  I'm just saying you should be honest with him about your feelings and with yourself about what you can and can't handle.

The important part to my theory is it is both 


1. ""Extroverted"" 


2. Tert J function

It is very important that you understand that the  J functions (F/T) are the functions that are always active. Your P functions (S/N) are the functions that you actually have to ""consciously"" use. 

This is why EXXP's are the hardworking P's because their Tert is always active. But just weaker. Furthermore, their tert is Fe/Te both extroverted J functions, which are the most useful functions in today's society.

&gt; It's because people feel that they are ""unstoppable"" it's for that reason whenever people are in conflict they get them. Because with the EXTJ in the picture, they feel like they can't lose.

I dislike not having him present for more heavy competitive things because the energy the guy gives off is great. At times I have found that I'm the one trying to calm down all the hype because being too cocky can bad in that ""the bigger they are, the harder they fall"". I often find that when I'm in a messy situation I just don't want to bother with it unless the charisma from the Te dom is present.

&gt; Now the same can be said for ESTP's HOWEVER the ESTP doesn't have the same level of loyalty as the EXTJ and therefore they are prone to be the devil's advocate and may turn on their friends if they feel their friends are irrational.

&gt; The EXTJ's (because of their FI) are more prone to deal in absolutes, and therefore they CAN be capable of unquestioned loyalty.

I also really agree with these observation as well in that the one ExTP in the group is kinda shifty at times as where the ENTJ tends to remain 'loyal' until the ExTP points out something that openly shakes his perception. The ESFP on the other hand doesn't really shift but trys to find middle ground way more often then the other two and in that way remains loyal. I tend to stay rather black and white on issues in taking one side or the other and holding to it and then trying to convince others that I'm right. Thankfully 3/4 all share Fi and we tend to have very similar views and opinions on things as where the ExTP doesn't really seem to care one way or another, hes just focused on everything staying cool and consistent so he just along for the ride... which leads to the shifty 'devil's advocate' nature.

Now, as an Ne dom you might look to your surroundings, see possibilities, and then spread them out through time in a hypothetical manner. The latter end of that is not Ne, it's Ni looking to create a consistent abstract understanding. You are not confined to 4 functions, no one is and with Ni being the opposite orientation of dominate you can use it very, very easily but it will be subservient to Ne and will thus work differently than an Ni dom. Whenever you find yourself looking to the future with possibilities you are engaging Ni, not Ne. You will use Ni to form a more natural state of consistency as opposed to Si despite the fact that Si is preferred. It simply comes down to the fact that while Si is preferred, Ni is stronger.

I have an example I'd like to share. There's a video of David Bowie having an interview for some french tv on youtube. And at some point Da-david.. Dave, trying to sell his cd, explains how he came about for the theme of his album. And he basically speaks about humanity in general and how we've progress and what changed during the last 2 centuries. Talking about how we've freed ourselves from religion and other negative craps but only to create the atomic bomb. It's a very Fi reasonning btw, this idea that humans always sabotage themselves. That no matter how many steps forward we take, we'll find something and take those steps back, only faster. 

I'll try and rephrase it once again --&gt; We are trying to advance as a species but deep inside, our nature is to destroy rather than built. Even in this civilized time, our nature reaches back to us and takes its claim. We destroy a lot faster than we build. That was his point.

Now that's not how the anchor responded. The anchor actually did a very shitty N thing and dismissed his idea for his own. He said ""humans can't have *nothing* we have to fill the void"". Which was not Dave's point. It was not entirely irrelevant but at the same time it was even worse than that. Do you see what I mean? Because those 2 ideas don't actually directly connect anywhere.

Mr Bowie made his sensor construction of idea. Going 1,2,3,4,5 only to arrive to his conclusion, 6. But that's not what the anchor did. The anchor just went directly to 8.

D was stimulating everyone's mind by just following his trail of thoughts and was definitly reaching its conclusion, the basic idea behind his album. But he could not because of some shitty generic sentence that really lead to nowhere. 

That's very typical N bug (O looking at you INFJs,ENTPs O). As a general rule I think Intuitives, especially N doms have, sometimes, huge blind spots that they are not aware of. Sensors either understand you or not but misunderstandings are typically an intuitive sin, I'd say. So yeah, For us trying to reach you, it would mean for us to read the books you've read.

Fair point, but maybe it's because I mostly see it that way. It doesn't help that the vast majority of information on the internet about MBTI (including on this very subreddit) gives it that impression.

&gt;They are simplified theoretical models

Exactly, they are theoretical. Have the functions or MBTI ever been empirically verified? If not, then it's all just a guessing game, even if it is a more ""educated"" one.

&gt;And if you get confused by which doll you're supposed to be, it's because you don't strongly resemble any of the sixteen on offer

Agreed, and I would think that this confusion is inevitable. I guess my main problem is that you use these functions in this order, or those functions in that order. What does that even mean? What if, for example, I relate equally to Ne and Se (and therefore ISFP and INFP)? I can't use both of them, so I have to pick one. Also why is it that when I get confused I'm essentially offered a different explanation as to why from every person I ask?

No type is bad! Every type is beautiful in their own way. I struggle with my type as well sometimes, but it's a part of recognizing and appreciating who you are. 

1) Empathy is never a bad thing. Those with strong T traits may tell you the opposite. I grew up with an ISTJ dad and felt incapable many times because I couldn't be logical like him, which made him angry. But ""feelers"" have it great, I believe. Simply because we can RELATE to other people! Something my ISTJ dad has trouble doing :) we are the people of the world who keep the love going.

2) Idealizing. Unfortunately, this just comes with being an N and wanting the best out of everything. I'm half INFP, half ISFP and I do the idealizing as well. It's a killer. The best way to deal with this is think about what you do have and focus on that. Don't focus on what *could* be or you will always be unsatisfied, and probably a generally grumpy person. Learn to thrive in the environment/relationship you're given. I have a lot of trouble with this in my relationship sometimes, but bottom line is I *adore* my boyfriend. And that's all that really matters sometimes.

3) Moodiness. This is the con to the F function while the pro is empathy. It does suck. But it means you're truly in sync with your emotions and that is never a bad thing. Unless, of course, you're using it to take your anger out on others which is pretty bad. As F's, we have to learn to simply control our emotions, but they will always be there.

I suck at pattern recognition and I'm also shit at figuring things out, because if I don't have a clue how something works I'm not very liable to come up with ideas out of thin air. Just today at work I stripped about 6 plastic screws out of a shelf before I realized that they unscrew from the bottom, because in my mind they had exactly the same function as the other shelf pegs that you *do* pull straight out, and because my Se took in that definition I broke 6 of them in a row before even attempting to repurpose the object in my mind.

That makes me sound like I'm a total airhead because I have aux Se instead of Ne, and while that's true to a certain extent, there are times when Se works to your advantage. I'm very observant (albeit inconsistently), and specifically for ISFP my Se is very good at reading other people's emotions. I see an expression or hear a tone of voice and I can connect it to an emotion others may not perceive.

I think you're trying to connect aux Se or Ne to specific actions, as you said exercising, going out, etc., but that's not how those functions manifest. I'm an ISFP, and I'm much better at writing lyrics than making music, but actions and processes aren't directly linked like that.

And when you have to stand in it only shin deep, it is still better than standing there cold, but the frustration of not being able to sink all the way in is also maddening in the way that an unreachable itch is. It doesn't make you angry, it just drives you insane.

After you've left it, when you're still feeling warm, you may curl up and just enjoy the contentment of feeling relaxed and comfortable. And when it wears off and you get cold again, you learn to give it to yourself when you can't get it agan from outside. When cold nips at you, you go out for a hard run, and when you get back, you collapse onto your couch, feeling warm, sweaty, relaxed, and satisfied. It is a good feeling, and a feeling you know how to look for partly because of experiencing the other warmth... But even though it is very pleasant in its own, intense way, to give yourself that warmth and be satisfied with yourself -- and it pushes you to achieve more than if you had never felt the warmth before --  it is still very special and satisfying when you can sink into the warmth of someone else, in a way that you can't ever quite match.",ISTJ,305,1573,ISTJ

are mutually exclusive.

If he were a conquistador, he would have taken the time to develop the social skills required to ask for your phone number without trembling hands or encouragement from an outsider.

Also, from your description, you can't be ""just another conquest"" since y'all ""didn't go all the way"" (that's a euphemism for ""sex,"" right?).  Pretty sure ""conquest"" requires going ""all the way.""

1) He got scared, panicked, and didn't know what to do, so he clammed up.

2) He actually has family obligations, which he takes very seriously.

Also, it could be both.

So, here's my list of advice:

1) Don't be afraid to initiate.  If you're waiting for him to make the first move, you'd better be wearing your comfy everything.  There's a fair chance he *won't* make the move(s) needed to move things forward because he may just not **have** any moves (I know I don't).

2) Next time you talk to him, be direct.  If you want to see where the relationship can go, straight up tell him ""I'm interested in you and where this relationship might go.  I know you may have some stuff going on, and I can respect that, but let's figure out what works and put something on the schedule.""

3) Be patient.  It sounds to me like he's interested but not sure how to proceed.  He'll get there as long as you can prod sufficiently without railroading.

Where is the participation from the members? They're permitted to participate, but if they decide to go jam on 500 threads other than the ones you start, is that valued?

What keeps the country and folk fans there? The rock fans? The R&amp;B fans? The rap fans?

What keeps the alphas (NTP/SFJ), betas (STP/NFJ), gammas (NTJ/SFP), and deltas (STJ/NFP) there?

What is most important to the integrity of your group? What does the person who loves this group more than they love their mother love about it? The bandwidth of genres? The regular stimulation? The opportunity to explore new music? The exposure to genre defying, genre defining, genre intersecting, and genre expanding music? 

In your darkest nightmares, where your name is carved in stone above the archway to an active and thriving group, but you are ashamed of it... what has it become that has you hiding, not showing your face in public, and crying yourself to sleep?

I go places that are fun in the ways I find fun, or that have lots of room for me to get what I want out of them. A space that demanded excessive commitment, for instance, will never have me in it, or anyone who is looking for a more ""whenever you like"" engagement. Or a space that is dedicated to mostly things that are irrelevant to me will lose me quickly. ""Genre I hate week. What about next-- oh I guess it's genres of underwhelm month."" So for instance, if I don't take music Very Seriously, but that is required to enjoy the space, I'll mosey on out. Though if I do, I might hang around, but I'll also be in the minority of people, just by nature, since we all have different interests and intensities of interest. Can your group accommodate the casual as easily as the connoisseur? Do you want it to?

Not knowing your answers to these questions, I think you could inject life by inviting them to share and contribute in a structured way -- for instance, ""what is your favorite genre and an example of that genre?"" ""what is your type and your favorite song?"" Allowing multiple submissions for those who can't decide. ""What makes a song country versus folk? Do you prefer one over the other? Like both? Hate both? Have examples you want to share of the worst and best of each? Have fusions of the two you'd like to share?""

Create these alongside your presentation of content -- later, as people participate more and generate those threads themselves, you can focus more on content and people will appreciate the regularity and tending -- but that content has to invite participation in the page or they have no reason to engage it on a social media platform. You might also ensure that nobody has too long of a dry spell. If I'm picky and only like country, I'll love country week... And might stay if every other genre has a country x genre fusion in it! That would be curious and might expand my preferences, and it means I'm at least getting a regular chance to have my preferences touched on more heavily.

Also it might help to educate alongside presenting -- thread one, here are some country songs -- which do you like? What do they share? What makes them different? What is the essence of a country song? Are there any of these that seem more country than the others, or that you wouldn't call country? You post those questions, then each song is a comment, so they can interact more easily with the content... Then 3-4 days later you give a description of what music theorists say characterizes a country song and ask if they're surprised, etc. Or anything else -- but basically, I know I have no idea about genres so if that is a focus I'm going to be feeling kind of left behind and out of my element. Again, might not be a problem if you're targeting a specific crowd! At the same time, I might join the crowd or stay on if you help me catch up.

Not all of this will probably apply but that is what came to mind! Basically, figure out what unpredictable content you're inviting them to provide, and make sure it's not just patronizing. Identify who you want to be interested, who you don't care about, and who you want to stay away (if the last group draws a blank, here's an example -- the person whose favorite genre is looping dancing animal or clumsy human gifs set to funny music...? ;)). Once there's a strong pulse, ask what they want more of, or what they want different.

If they feel like they're there for you, they'll leave -- if you create a successful community space I'd expect it to be focused and of great consistent interest, but with small membership, or less focused, with a thriving community, that often engages in conversation and interaction that bores you. But in the latter case, they can still appreciate your creation and stewardship of the space, with a rotating subset participating in your created content! Draw them in, but remember, you can't get them to do anything, you can only kind of... Do what you love and be clear about how far from that you're comfortable straying, and then... Well, love it more than you need others to love it while being grateful when others enjoy it with you! 

The last part is not to say you're not being grateful -- just that is the complete mindset that I have the most success operating on.

I also love crabs of any species, octopi/octopoda, jellyfish, and anything else of the like. I frequently collect sand dollars at my local beach in the summer for fun. I wade out as far as I dare at low tide and dig them out. They are easy to find. Then I hold them and tickle their little feet. I love to watch them move. It looks like hundreds of tiny hairs. Then I fling them back into the sea. I imagine them saying ""WHEEEEEE!!!!"" I get pissed at the god damned tourists who steal them and take them home. Not only is it illegal but they are assholes. 
My favorite place in a zoo is the aquarium. My favorite place in the world is an aquarium of any kind. The Charleston aquarium is pretty good. I also liked the Tacoma zoo for its fish and reptile section.

As i stated earlier its running almost all the time and i tend to notice it more when there is not much going on and its pretty much exactly the same as what happens when i read a book and i don't find it very special because it feels normal but now that i think about it life would be boring without it, i guess that's just due to the fact i'm introverted and having a running commentary on something always makes it better. :P

926357,"Unfortunately, the paradigm that your parents have is the predominant one in our culture. Collectively, we view the extroverts as the leaders - the trailblazers who pave the way for our societal progress. From the youngest ages of schooling, where children are clumped into round tables or groups of 4 or 5 desks rather than having their own defined work station, we are indoctrinated into the ideology that extroversion is the key to all forms of success.

This is not entirely untrue - about half of the population are extroverted, and as such, for them this system is highly beneficial. For the other half of us, however, we are forced to adapt to a method of functionality that is not consistent with our environment for highest performance, lest we be viewed as ""antisocial"" ([a gross misnomer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001919/)) and/or entirely ostracized from our peers. 

In short, our society is grossly and undeniably biased to favor the extroverts among us. Introverts are widely viewed as ""flawed"" or ""odd-balls"" - something to be fixed, not admired. This is an unfortunate stigma that all introverted individuals face to some degree or another. 

Perhaps you could try showing your parents [this](http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts.html) TED talk (incidentally, my main source for many of these facts) as it is a level-headed approach to the situation.

251928,"I don't know if this will be helpful, but having debated between INTP and ENTP a good deal, here are some observations that you *might* find helpful -- but of course, will not be absolutes that apply to *every* STJ, or *every* NTP.

* One thing that never fit for me about INTPs, once I was debating between INTP and ENTP, is that I just do not have a judging-dominant perspective. I had a pretty strong sense that I was a perceiving-dominant -- coming to judgments just was not as natural as wanting to explore and experience things uncritically.
* One thing that didn't fit for me about ENTPs, was that I am simply not as much of an extroverted personality. It fit better, because it was a perceiving dom with the same axis, but while I also enjoyed some Ne activity, I was not as inclined to throw myself out at the world or into the world. For me, small doses of Ne-stimulation are great -- like going to a research conference. The presentations will stimulate a lot of thinking about what studies *could* be done, or what variables *could* be looked at, etc. But it wasn't something I was doing 100% of the time. It was a healthy part of my psyche, but it was a special part (and usually our dom functions don't feel special in that way).
* One thing that was misleading was that ENTPs have a reputation for enjoying debate -- I have found that Si-Te does a fine job in my own case of producing the same approach. I like a discussion, so long as there is a baseline level of respect from all parties. Once that is assured, I think it is the Te in me that gets me wanting to explain my logic to others, get others to understand it, and arrive at that kind of consensus -- whether I am listening or doing a lot of the talking.

&gt;there has to be a better way to figure this shit out

I would look into the function axes more and work from there -- the difference between Si-dom and Ne-dom is considerable, but not nearly as absolute as people suggest. ENTPs *can* get things done, engage in stable behavior, have a basic framework for the world and their place in it... and ISTJs *can* have ideas, think about things that aren't yet a reality, come up with theories. Now, there is a difference in the relative amount, but it isn't all or none. So work on finding out which function axes fit you, and that should narrow it down to four types. ISTJs and INFPs share Si-Ne and Fi-Te, and that basic language *unites* them more than it *divides* them into Si versus Ne and Fi versus Te.

A cool guide to typing yourself was posted here a while back... and deleted D: That's an unpleasant surprise! I... had started typing a bunch of advice and then I remembered that guide existed, and now I am at a loss because it was much better and more thorough than what I had.

Well, in any event, my advice to start with function axes stands -- and from there, explore the four types that that would place you within. Also pay attention to what kinds of common complaints you have about members of the other four quadras (the socionics term for these clusters of four types that share functions).

But ISTJ ended up fitting quite well! Though a lot of how it fits has been stuff I had to piece together myself from the good stuff and the bullshit on the internet.

Toph is validated by how others value her, even if they are strangers in a crowd cheering her on or some random girls making fun of her makeup.

She's very much aware of the social and emotional dynamics of those around her, even if she prefers to ignore them most of the time. Inferior Fe at the age of 12 would not be nearly as aware of these dynamics as Toph, nor would it navigate them as well as Toph does.

The general point though, is that I would think a faithful, believable representation of a human character at least *could* have the markings of a certain type. 

Some things will degrade this possibility such as: (1) Plot-driven shows that modify character motivations and dynamics as needed for the story, (2) characters who have several writers, especially to the extent that there is no primary writer for the character, nor any essential personality that the writers attend to, (3) a character that is written in one way, but played by an actor who has a different personality or style. Of course, not a complete list.

However, other things might enhance the possibility, like: (1) Character-driven stories that aim to accurately and faithfully portray the emotions and workings of humans, both their merits and flaws -- and, importantly, that allow events to be guided by natural character interactions, rather than by inflexible plot points that might require violation of a character's natural motivations, (2) characters who are written and acted by individuals who match the general personality or core of the character, (3) shows that allow actors to provide some input into the story and into the lines they are provided -- in essence, allowing the actor's internalization of the character they are playing guide the storyline as to what is natural and believable for that character, and what isn't. 

You're right that, because they are not real people, they won't have a real type in the essential sense. Some may have types that change by season, by episode, by story arc. However, to the extent that fiction portrays believable human beings, I would argue that the resulting characters would be possible to tentatively type. Of course, one single writer cannot probably write all types in a believable fashion -- however, if characters are described through the lens of well-written characters, we may still (1) be able to type the observed character or at least narrow down some of their function preferences, and (2) be able to see some of how one members of one personality type might view another. Perhaps I could not write the internal world of an ESTP in a believable way, but I might be able to write a very believable account of how an ISTJ character might view and assign motivation to ESTP character.",ISTJ,466,2780,mbti

1287671,"Yes, Fascism is a fail.

From Wikipedia: 

&gt;The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry, and is a natural unifying force of people.

This inevitably leads to social tensions.  Whether its the the Jews, the Arabs, the blacks, or some other ""undesirable"" group, fascism requires that you turn the majority against the minorities.

Fascism requires a totalitarian state.  One party, no choice.  Because people can't be unified if there is internal opposition.  People don't like that.  People like choice, or at least the illusion of choice.  That's why even Saddam Hussein held elections when he ran Iraq.  Nevermind that since his people counted the votes, he tended to win with 97% or so of the vote, but people felt like they had a choice, because there were elections.

Fascism bastardizes both socialism and capitalism, trying to cherry pick the ""best"" parts of both systems and failing at either.  It tries to maintain profit motivation by allowing private ownership of companies, but only if those companies produce in the interests of the State.

Fascism encourages violence, especially when it is used to purge the nation of ""socially and biologically weak or degenerate people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.""

Even without military intervention, Fascism is doomed to failure just as much as Communism is and always has been.

Then again, it doesn't really matter what form of government a nation chooses.  If a nation can't become strong enough to defend itself, it will be destroyed by outside forces.  If a nation starts building itself into an empire, it will either completely collapse under its own weight (Rome) or it will collapse to a size it can actually support (Britain).  A government exists only to protect the rights of its citizens, and it exists and the will and the pleasure of those citizens.  The moment it ceases to do the former, it has to start worrying about losing the latter.

Or at least so goes my stance on it.",ISTJ,354,2123,mbti
1726013,"Hi! Thanks for the insight, think the perspective on ""trust"" you've provided can be a much-needed rationalisation for folks like me (""trust"" as a honed skill &amp; function). Always felt the need to justify the different aspects of life and be accountable to myself, be it visible to others or not. :/ Appreciate the honesty you're approaching this from: ""Not sure why this type likes to torment itself on that"" - had me in a little chuckle at how we manage to confuse ourselves sometimes :D it's like an endless loop hahah. 

Now the thing is trusting itself. I've never remotely known how to ""trust"" and let loose, it's always ""perceive first, act later"". In and out of every place it's how I've learned to live 20 years of life, though I'm aware it's a conscious choice which I've grown to regret. Both my parents' own personal developments, from what I've learned, bear this as a similarity. Momma always was the silent observer yielding to others at every place, conditioned to supress herself to preserve the now. Dad was a responsible, duty-driven person in and out of home and was a connoisseur of his own very private interests. Outside of family I've picked up this more than I'd like, could be a case of hedgehog's dillema and that I've grown too accustomed to viewing the world through my own romanticised or distanced lens.

This trust thing carries over to the point of overriding, let's say, my body language. As you've surmised, there's only so much one can control (so we ought to accept that c'est la vie, which is something that's been sorely missing in me), like it or not this gives rise to certain revealing ""tells"". Long, purposeful strides but I thread lightly, not committing to any particular decision of the moment, ""I'll gather more information then decide"". Shoulders and back locked in place, always maintaining against an ever-present contingency. In response, body almost ""snaps"" to attention (in the presence of others). Often get remarked that I walk composed &amp; guarded like a patrolling soldier lul, largely unnatural. Needless to say it's been affecting my quality of life (oh snap, at some points of life we need others to get by?!) Don't expect you to relate to this realisation but I'm not sure if it helps you to understand where I'm coming from, cos I don't think I even know myself atm.

Perhaps this is more representative than going into my life again which'd turn into yet another headless ramble (I almost never talk about myself and when I do, it turns into a mess like what I'm doing rn lol. Ugh). You've confirmed what I've to do (in essence, to accept one's realm of control and smell the roses), so how do I go about.. doing it? In one's day-to-day doings that is. I remain so guarded against others and my innermost self that I'm not sure how should I live this life as a functional human being who's capable of experiencing, relating, living. My previous supervisor once pointed out that I gotta chill and find things that I like (not a problem) and let loose upon (more than I'd like to admit, a problem). Closest thing I've had to this is meditation and working out but clearly it hasn't been enough for me to come to terms with myself.

Funnily enough I don't hate impersonal communication (out of necessity or ""convenience""). At times, I find myself enjoying it more than interactions with known ""friends"" (which comes as a surprise to me - so I do enjoy meeting new people!) - surmises my interpersonal life right there.

92464,"Three things:

1. While your emotions are often infectious, you can be overbearing and obnoxiously loud and distracting with them. For best example, see Drax in Guardians vol.2 and / or Lwaxana Troi in Star Trek. Some don't like this and being coerced into emotions as it were. Sometimes sublimely(by trying to trigger mirror neurons), sometimes directly(social norms and other SFJ nonsense).
2. There is a lot of INxx types in MBTI and IN types like quiet or at least normal atmosphere. You guys keep laughing and chatting and going over what feels like nonsense to most IN people.
3. What you mentioned, the lack of character. SFJs can vey easily get impressed and change their tune based around whom they are. This has equally Si and Fe parts. Some people don't like such...spineless behavior. SFJs are fair enough, but not completely trustworthy imo.

But I won't hate you just because you are SFJ. I'll hate you if you are domineering, overbearing, sleazy, useless piece of shit with an overblown ego.

1158763,"ISTJ here, romantically involved with an ENTP for ~1.5 years. So, as a blanket statement, it *can* work ;)

A few hopefully helpful suggestions below:

1. **Be explicitly clear with what you expect from us, at all times.** As an ISTJ, I need to exactly know what is expected of me at all times, so I can A) fulfill my duty and B) excel at said duty. This is true for what you expect/want out of the relationship, and even simple things like wanting him to wash dishes after dinner. We are not mind readers, and we will not pick up on subtle, passive, or indirect clues. We’re more than happy to oblige; we just have to know what it is we need to be obliging. 
Chances are, your ISTJ was freaked out when you were talking to someone else because he didn't have pre-set **(read: explicit)** guidelines for what you two were. So, he was thinking Does she not like me? Is she still looking for someone else? What are we even doing? It sounds paranoid, but it's more that we freak out when there's no structure; we feel like a fish out of water. I imagine for an ENTP, you'd likely feel like a caged animal in your equivalent situation (i.e. too much structure).

2. **Be nice to us. Even jest can hurt our feelings.**
This comes mostly from being an introvert, but ISTJs are sensitive people. We’re not crybabies or overly affectionate, but we take most (all?) criticism to heart. It’s hard for us to hear “Mary, I have some edits to your article” and NOT hear “Mary, you suck at writing” or “Mary, you can’t do your job correctly” And what are we, if we can’t do our tasks correctly? I am not at all saying you shouldn’t be direct and honest with him—please be. But, be gentle. 

3. **Don’t bend to meet our needs all the time.**
I add this last one more as a general relationship advice, and less of an ENTP/ISTJ advice, though it applies to both. Be aware of the differences between you two, but don’t do all the personality bending for him. Make sure he does some for you, too. 

EXAMPLE: My ENTP and I, as you can relate, have different approaches when it comes to timeliness. My ENTP has literally told me, “Time is an illusion.” All the clocks in the house say something different, and it doesn’t make ANY sense to me. But we’ve (accidently?) established a system: For certain events—like family cookouts—we arrive on time. And on other days, he has things he kinda wants to maybe do, and I get in his car and he controls our agenda for the afternoon (which means we drive around and I have no idea where we’re going. Which is terrifying because I like to know where we’re going, for how long, am I dressed correctly?, and what if I have to pee?). It’s just give and take. You’ll have to try to be on time sometimes, and he’s going to have to try to be late sometimes.

Well, do you believe in equality, regardless of gender or race?

Do you believe in democracy? In the people's right to decide?

Are you against corporate interests and lobbyism in politics?

Are you against exploitation of the common people?

If your answer is yes, good, because so is Socialism. Socialism is democracy. It believes the Means of Production should be in the hands of the workers, so that the workers can decide what exactly they are working for. It believes the profits should be divided fairly amongst the workers, and not a system of wage-labour where the CEO and investors reap millions and the worker a few thousand.

Are you against the idea that just because my parents were millionaires, I should be a millionaire? Do you believe the life of a factory worker in Bangladesh is inherently less valuable than that of a CEO in America?

These are the questions Socialism asks. In contrast to Capitalism, which encourages human greed and selfishness to a sociopathic level, Socialism encourages working towards the common good and to the mutual benefit of all.

Anarcho-Socialism essentially involves the dissolution of the state and decentralization of any government. It highly emphasizes community, equality, and mutual aid.

The idea is that all privately own property that is geared towards production will be made public, where people can still hold private(/personal) property based on residence and use.

This might sound cliche, but I would suggest that you be yourself as much as possible. Unfortunately, when it comes to anything interpersonal or emotional we are just awful at reciprocating. For example, I have been in a 10 year relationship with an INFP who I care for more than anyone in the world. However, it took her at least 5 years to accept that I am really uncomfortable hugging or saying ""I love you"". Instead we tend to show our affection through action, which can be difficult for some people to accept (understandably).

Also, it might help to keep in mind that ISTP or not, some people are just not friendly. That's their problem.

Part of what I like about ENFPs are that you genuinely want to understand people. We, on the other hand, want to understand things. I think if you keep that subtle difference in mind it might help you find some mutual ground so as to make your working day a little more tolerable!

244583,"**TLDR** I analyze a lot of emotions to rationalize them away. If it is something genuine to be upset about I cry or exercise it away, then revisit the situation for analysis. Then move on.  

So, (and trying to sound superior) I've definitely developed my F compared to some ISTP I've seen here and definitely compared to what I use to be. I say that to help you understand the spectrum (which I think it's still a pretty small spectrum if I'm the high end). (Also I don't see it as a good or bad thing, just different). 

I use to keep everything (every little things) bottled up until eventually something unhealthy would happen (as  someone else said). Lots of bad shit, studying other people, and ""Feeling"" gf's later: I've gotten a lot better at emotions. 

Now if I get really sad or angry I don't ignore it. I analyze it. I figure out why I am sad or angry, most of the time I can then just rationalize it away, because my feeling is ""silly"" when I look at the whole situation. If it's something that I can legitimately be upset about  (probably once, maybe twice, a year) then I channel that by either crying for a few minutes (sad) or exercise (anger). Then I reevaluate the situation, update my mental portfolio on the people involved and move on. 

The only person I ever talk to about the latter set of emotions is my SO. She is also the only SO I've trusted enough to do so. 

(Side note: I cry at weird things all the time. I get super invested into books or shows and over analyze and create my own interpretation of what the character is going through. Basically I create an in depth emotional attachment to characters by analyzing what might be unsaid by the author or writer or if the writers are actually good at character development and interaction. E.g. Serenity and Wash, gets me every fucking time. 

Or if it's a Pixar movie. Fuck you Pixar. I watched Up last night... Bawled my eyes out at the intro (again). I don't consider these the same kinds of emotions, because they aren't from real world situations and they are fleeting/don't require analysis.)

Annoyance is probably my most expressive emotion. I find it difficult to hide this one. Stupid people and people bothering me with mundane things just irks me. 

Most other emotions are muted. I do get happy, but I just kind of smile and enjoy it and move on. I feel a lot of enjoyment when I'm alone, but it's more like ""inner peace""? I've been told by my SO when I am truly happy/excited I show it. And with her pointing it out enough I have started to notice it. I get a warm fuzzy feeling in my chest.

Empathy and sympathy, not there. Lol. I just don't. I fake it. I fake it when I absolutely have to, or if I really care about the person (like five people in my life are worth it) I will try my damnest to seem sincere. But most the time, zero fucks given.

I think that's what loneliness is - it's not that there aren't people around you, it's just that there aren't any people that you respect or feel emotionally connected to enough for their opinions to matter. You feel you have all these thoughts and ideas in your head and yet nobody you've deemed ""worthy"" to bounce them off of, whether to validate them, refute them or to simply give you a different perspective. And since you mentioned having one person which provides you the feedback you crave, you're worried that if you rely on him/her exclusively you'll start bothering him/her and appear annoying and needy. The sad thing is you're probably right to be worried about that unless that person similarly enjoys bouncing their ideas off you and engages you in conversation often.

You're definitely not asking for too much, but it's a lot harder to find people interested in discussing philosophy/deeper topics than it is to find people interested in talking about the latest trends, for example. Especially if you want those discussions to take place face-to-face, I've found that very few people are capable, willing and confident enough in their opinions to risk talking about them with people they don't know especially well.

Probably goes double for introverts. I think it's safe to say people like us generally think a lot and say a little, so when it comes to topics that we've spent a lot of time thinking about, the person we're trying to talk to about these things quickly gets overwhelmed and oftentimes discouraged because we seem so much more prepared and they don't think they can keep up or offer us anything that we haven't already thought of. Which further contributes to the feeling of being different/alienated/misunderstood/surrounded by idiots.

As for ways to cope with this, I'll write down what I've been doing and what I've had some good success with. 

Step one would be observation - taking a careful look at your surroundings. The people, their body language, the words they use to express themselves(I'd wager there's a good chance most introverts are a good deal more eloquent than most extroverts), how willing they are to voice opinions that might seem controversial and how comfortable they seem to be in talking about their personal beliefs/worldview. Also look for similarities in tastes, be it music, shows, books, hobbies. It's a lot easier to approach someone that you know or feel you have something in common with, especially if you're shy. During my first year of high school, this is is pretty much all I did - I didn't fall into any groups of people, I merely observed my classmates so that I could have better chances of forming lasting friendships with good people.

Step two - now that you have a good idea of the people you could potentially get along with, look for things you have in common and things you can use to initiate a conversation, even if it's only a single sentence. For example if you notice you're enjoying the same song, ask them something about it - do they like the artist in general, what is their favorite song from that artist, do they generally listen to that type of music(if not, what to they listen to?) and so on. People generally don't mind it if you show interest/curiosity as long as it comes off in a friendly way. A single one-sentence conversation can make it much easier for you to approach them again at a later point, because you now have one more thing in common - you've talked, however briefly it might have been. You are no longer a face in the crowd of people they've never interacted with.

Step three - if the first interaction ended on a friendly note, approach them again with something you know(or strongly suspect) they'd be interested in talking about, however trivial it might be. The more you talk to people, the easier it gets. The more shared experiences you have, the easier it is to talk. 

By going through these three steps I was able to attain a group of friends that I was comfortable around and could talk about a lot of stuff with. As time went on(we graduated, went our separate ways) we understandably interact/ed a lot less often. And yet I'm confident that if we happened to be in the same place/country for a long enough period of time, we could easily arrange a meeting and have a good time like we were never apart, because we knew each other well and had mutual trust in our intelligence and integrity.

Of course, being shy makes it very difficult to approach people first, thus making steps two and three deceptively difficult to follow. And yet it is possible to be both shy and very confident about something, be it a particular skill you've attained, knowledge about a subset of pop culture you happen to enjoy or a field that you're very interested in. So the advice would be, focus on your strengths at first and try to talk about things you're knowledgeable about with people you feel might be interested. However - and this is very key - try your best not to overwhelm them and approach them as if they have no or very little prior knowledge to the topic of discussion. Usually the last thing you want to come off as when trying to form friendships is the insufferable know-it-all. Appearing knowledgeable, but humble has much better results in my experience.

Approaching people can be terrifying if you're not used to it, but remember this - you can only get better at something by practicing it. Everything is difficult at first. None of us walked/talked properly on our first try, and yet a very large portion of the human race walks/talks with complete confidence now. Another thing to note the people you're approaching are ultimately that - people. Just by virtue of that you have so much in common with so many of them. You have similar anatomy, you speak the same(or similar) languages, you walk in the same places, you use your senses in nearly identical ways, you interact with the same society ...

From your post I think what you're looking for can be best described as a kindred spirit. And while finding one usually takes a lot of effort, time and often luck, having even a single one can make a huge difference in your outlook on life.

I actually think we have it a lot easier than anyone in the last millennium ever had it - we have access to the internet and sufficient technology to facilitate near-instantaneous communication from nearly any place on the planet to any other place on the planet. That alone makes it a lot easier for us to find like-minded people. I fully agree that face-to-face interaction is the most fulfilling form, but forums, IM chats, PMs or even e-mails can be helpful as well. Knowing that you're not the only one that feels a certain way is empowering on its own. I hope this was helpful. OP or anyone that posted in this thread, I'd be fine with talking to you either via PM or an alternate channel of communication, as long as anonymity is maintained.

184939,"&gt;You do not make every decision about everything independently every time. You just don't.

I explained my process. I get the urge to have something, I go out and buy what I need to make that happen. Generally it's different things, since i don't really care for specifics, but other times I know I like a certain product and will buy it again.

&gt;Marketing has influenced that. You didn't magically know what you wanted.

Really? My urges seem ""magical"" to me. I'll randomly get urges to go buy stuff. So I do. I hardly ever see ""marketing"". The only time i ever encounter ads is when I'm actually in the store, and by that time I usually already know what I'm going to get. Sometimes I'll make a spur-of-the-moment decision (to buy cookies or something). But generally I already know what I'm going to get before I walk in the store.

&gt;Do you buy a different brand of toilet paper every time just because? The answer is no. You habitually buy stuff. Everyone does.

Yup. Same goes for shampoo, soap, deodorant, etc. It's different every time I get it. Sometimes I'll just go by price (whatever is cheapest) other times I'll go by how much there is in the pack, and still other times I'll pick based on the design.

&gt;You keep saying you are immune to Marketing. You aren't. You are just able to recognize whats happening. That is not the same as immune.

As I said, the only time I'd be able to be ""affected"" by marketing would be in the store. At which point I already know what I'm getting.

&gt;I'll edit this post when I find it, but there is a study out there that shows that people who believe they are immune to Marketing techniques are actually more susceptible to them.

I already know a lot of marketing techniques/tricks. But I'm guaranteeing they don't work on me. I'd invite you over to show you how I go about doing things, but you probably don't live anywhere near me.

There's literally no way for marketing to affect what I buy. Perhaps it affects if I buy brand X vs brand Y, but really, I don't care about that. I buy whatever's cheap. And I suppose if ""be cheap"" is a marketing technique, then yea, I'm susceptible to it.

You could define *anything* to be a marketing technique and thus require everyone to be susceptible to them. That's not the point.

By ""marketing"" I assume you mean commercials, ads, flyers, labels, etc. Which is what I'm responding to.

My choice in what to buy comes from various urges I get. I have a  few key things/places I like, so I routinely go there, sure. But it's not just because I was influenced by marketing. It's because I like the product. That's not marketing, that's just a good product.",ISTP,481,2660,intj

From what I hear it's not just my own personal trait that we like to listen, so tell him about yourself and what you like.

As for how do we like to feel/what kind of vibes do we like.... I'll just answer personally since I can't speak for everyone. 
I definitely don't like to feel pressure on me, and I don't like people who feel entitled to me, or anything like that at all. I don't like people who seem very... pretentious, unreasonable, and impractical. Those are red flags to me. Anyone who can't shut up and just enjoy companionable silence ultimately isn't someone I can fully enjoy being around either.

Uh, anyone who forces anything onto me, period? Fuck that shit and fuck the fuck who fuckin' tries that. Again idk if this is shared, but I have a very deep dislike of authority, and people who try to force their values on me will meet cold indifference or bratty retaliation. (Keep in mind, discussing values and forcing them onto people are two entirely different things. You can def discuss values without forcing them onto others and it can be a great conversation. )

I like it when people trust me, and have confidence in me and what I do. I like respect of my boundaries, and I like when people show that by asking my permission before they do something with me/involving me. I like when people take a real interest in me and do it respectfully by asking me, rather than like, trying to investigate me. People who try to stalk me or ""figure me out"" or interrogate me will automatically become enemies in my mind, and I will fucking clam up around them harder than ever in retaliation. Especially when I would've told them had they just asked about whatever they wanted to learn about me instead-- or at least respected my answer if I had said no. Also anyone who feels fake or superficial is just- no. We can tell, and we avoid the shit out of those ones.  
So uh... respectful vibes? Patient vibes? Someone who's calm and interested and warm and respectful and all that. 

A lot of people in my life have told me that they feel bad or insecure in comparison to me because they can't match my energy (when my switch is on), my interest levels, or they might not be as talented as I am, and they feel because of that, their friendship, or what they can bring to the table, may not be enough, and this is absolutely not true. I personally have never wanted to be impressed by anybody (in fact, my need to be better than everyone is the only thing that makes me feel OK.) or wanted anyone to be as intense as I am, or match me. I don't have high expectations of others and don't want anyone to feel that I do, or try and  raise themselves up to me before they can have a relationship with me, or feel they need to do that to feel validated in having a relationship with me. To me, if I've allowed anyone into my life already, it's because I think they're pretty goddamn amazing as it is. Usually if someone has the ability to listen and likes what I say, that's more than enough, and I'll love them forever.

Collateral damage is shitty. It's terrible that children get harmed and killed. That's the worst thing to ever happen in an act of violence like this. But every movement is a terror organization when it starts and there's always civilian targets at some point or another. 

Mandela's acts of terror were bombing civilians and school buses full of white children, and he's hailed as a man of peace. Michael Collins, the Irish revolutionary, put hits out on civilians all the time, and he's loved by us. Castro rounded up and imprisoned or killed all those who opposed his Socialist/Communist ideals, and there are people all over the world who support him, let alone the Cubans. And that's just getting started. 

The old adage applies here; One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Russian Imperialism is the root cause of these terror attacks. The First &amp; Second Chechnyan Wars, the subsequent oppression of Nationalist movements in the Caucasus regions has lead to the rise of Islamist Radicalism in Chechnya, Dagestan, and so on. The involvement in Syria does not held either, especially when you're facing people with the financial means of the Saudi Princes, who can fund terror attacks forever. 

I know that if Ireland today was still under the rule of England, that we were denied our right to self determination, that the English people were supporting their government and what they were doing, that we were oppressed and denied our freedom, I would pull the trigger myself. Some people are willing to kill for their ideals, some are even willing to die for them, and while they're not right, they're not *wrong* either, and we can't judge right from wrong, from the outside because we can't possibly share their perspective or their experiences.

I've always made my opinion clear when it comes to independence movements; Every people has a *right* to self determination. I see the right to one's own country as a basic human right that is denied to too many all over the world. While terrorism is never the first option before peaceful and political negotiation, it should never be ruled out as ""evil"" or ""wrong"" when all else fails. And all else *has* failed in Russia. 

If we ruled out every resistance movement as ""evil"" or ""terrorism"" or ""wrong"", then you can say goodbye to the Irish Republican Army in the War of Independence, which was labelled by the British government as terrorists, you can say goodbye to the French Resistance in World War II, you can say goodbye to the United States of America, you can say goodbye to Poland, and pretty much most of Eastern Europe, let's not forget the Baltic States, either. Or the Scandinavian ones for that matter. You can say goodbye to Pakistan and India and Bangladesh. It's endless.

Sure, but I'm not the one asserting type changes.

&gt; There is no way you know enough people intimately enough to

Implying I need to know people intimately to see that their MBTI hasn't changed.

&gt;b) have them take the test every so often to see if they've changed

Implying tests are the end-all be-all. We actually have direct evidence that the tests are unreliable and people tend to type differently every few months or so, depending on the test. This doesn't mean their type changes, rather that the test mistyped.

&gt;c) quantify and then attribute how their personalities have changed over time to one of their MBTI functions.

This I can certainly do. The process typically goes something like: dom/aux function are used primarily in childhood and through to middle/highschool. At which point tertiary functions start to kick in. From there to about college age (""sophomore syndrome"") we get a dom/ter loop. These happen in each type, and appear differently. Finally, as we approach and enter adult hood, inferior functions finally start to flourish and begin developing. And throughout adult hood, tertiary and inferior functions tend to develop and mature.

&gt;Again, do you have any actual scientific evidence to back up your claims? 

Go take a look at big 5. It's essentially the science-backed version of MBTI. And it also claims something similar. Different personality traits grow at different times, with 'personality type' being mostly static after adulthood, with a couple of continuing trends.

Though I'd like to extend a similar question: do you have any *actual scientific evidence* to back up MBTI?

&gt; Because unless a claim about MBTI you make is backed up by actual science, you're contributing to people's distrust of MBTI as well as being exceptionally irresponsible.

&gt;Outside the State there can be neither individuals nor groups (political parties, associations, syndicates, classes). Therefore Fascism is opposed to Socialism, which confines the movement of history within the class struggle and ignores the unity of classes established in one economic and moral reality in the State; and analogously it is opposed to class syndicalism. Fascism recognizes the real exigencies for which the socialist and syndicalist movement arose, but while recognizing them wishes to bring them under the control of the State and give them purpose within the corporative system of interests reconciled within the unity of the State.

&gt;...

&gt;Such a conception of life makes Fascism the precise negation of that doctrine which formed the basis of the so-called Scientific or Marxian Socialism

&gt;...

&gt;After Socialism, Fascism attacks the whole complex of democratic ideologies and rejects them both in their theoretical premises and in their applications or practical manifestations. Fascism denies that the majority, through the mere fact of being a majority, can rule human societies; it denies that this majority can govern by means of a periodical consultation; it affirms the irremediable, fruitful and beneficent inequality of men, who cannot be levelled by such a mechanical and extrinsic fact as universal suffrage.

And there's more. Socialism and Fascism are so far apart from eachother in motive, method, and outcome, that it isn't even laughable. Also take a look at Trotsky's *[Fascism: What it is and how to fight it](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm)*.

952796,"&gt;So for ISTP's (Ti Se Ni Fe) case is ENFJ (Fe Ni Se Ti) and the true opposite is INFP (Fi Ne Si Te) or ESTJ (Te Si Ne Fi)? Is it just the type with the same functions and order as our shadow or our shadow flipped in order?

IMO, these pairings would be ""ideal"". Same functions to allow decent/good communication. But different preferences to encourage growth. They aren't 'true' opposites, since functions are shared.

The ""true"" opposite to an ISTP would be (Ne Fi Te Si). AKA the ENFP. Note that not only are the functions *not* shared (not a single function is the same), but they are also differing orders for the types of functions as well. T/S for ISTP are both dom/aux, while for the ENFP they are ter/inf.

As I said, functionally, they cover each other's weaknesses. There's no gaps. But that will also cause communication problems. By not thinking or communicating the same, working together can be difficult.

The INFP/ESTJ pairing would be 'ideal' as the INFP can teach the ESTJ to use Fi/NE, and the ESTJ can teach the INFP to use Te/Si.

With the ISTP/ENFP pairing, no teaching can be done. While the ISTP can't/won't use Fi/Ne, the ENFP 'covers' it and takes care of those weak points. However, due to not sharing any functions, conflicts are bound to arise.

A possible ideal work-pair would be two types that share *some* functions, but differ in others. Like ISTP/ENTP (me and my bro :P).

ISTP has (Ti Se Ni Fe) and ENTP has (Ne Ti Fe Si). This allows for communication/understanding on the Ti/Fe front, while still allowing for the benefits of Se/Ne/Ni/Si. Is this an 'ideal' romantic pair? Perhaps. I wouldn't say so. There's still conversation/understanding problems, but they are less frequent than two types that share nothing in common.

It really depends on what you are looking for.

That's why in business, you'd want a management type that shares functions with each member. That way management can work smoothly, even if the individual employees don't share any functions. You can utilize the best of each function.

In personal relationships, I'd say the 'fake opposite' letter flip method would be best. As it allows for growth (no stale relationship) as well as decently smooth communication, that grows and becomes more smooth as time goes on. To me, that's ideal. The trick is getting the two parties to interact (as they'd constantly pull each other out of their comfort zones).

The ENFJ will keep forcing the ISTP to use Fe/Ni, while the ISTP will keep forcing the ENFJ to use Ti/Se. This is frustrating at first, if you don't understand what's going on or aren't flexible. However, in the long run, it's more beneficial to do so, than to stick with the same two dominant functions and pair up to an identical type (ISTP/ISTP). As the two ISTPs will feed off the Ti/Se and not develop the Ni/Fe.

Personally, I find the four letter flip ""pull out of comfort zone"" deal to be the best. It's the exact type of relationship I've been looking for, well before I found out about MBTI, so to me it makes sense. Others may want something different, and will look for corresponding partner for that.",ISTP,548,3132,mbti

None of this would've happened has Israel accepted the Palestinian surrender from the PA that conceded all the settlements on the West Bank and the Right of Return. None of this would've happened if Israel recognized Palestine as an independent state. None of this would've happened if Israel negotiated directly with Hamas, using words instead of bombs.

But hey, how dare the ~~Jews~~Palestinians rise up against the ~~Nazis~~Israelis?

Israel has a massive technological, social, and financial advantage over Palestine, yet they use methods that show what a farce any social progress they've made is. When the Israeli defense ministers are saying they're going to ""visit the Holocaust on Gaza"", or when they all praise the violence and murder of the IDF, or when they decide that despite the fact tunnels need two entrances to work, they needed to invade Gaza to get rid of them, or despite the fact that there's 50% more bombs and shells going *into* Gaza than coming *out* of it, Israel is still just defending itself against the ~~subhuman filth~~ terrorist Palestinians.",ISTP,254,1535,europe

1. I suggest you learn what and who Liberals are. This makes these things pretty much intuitive to you.

2. The title is as such because Liberals are essentially cultural supremacists who, as shown in this picture, quite constantly take thei high ground and highlight how our society is so much more ""developed"" and ""civilised"" than others, and fail to realise the errors that exist in Western societies when they make these claims(""Islam is so violent"" - Fails to notice that Liberal society produces bucket loads of media glorifying murder)

1173390,"Ok well the reason I asked that is because to me it seems a lot of Fi users mistake their Fi thinking for Ti logic. It never happens the other way round though. 

So how to tell the difference between Ti logic and 'Fi logic' as I like to call it.

The very black and white difference between the two, is that one includes self values in the thought process (Fi), while the other excludes all values entirely (Ti). 

The result of each, is that a Ti user will use their thinking to find the hard truth that excludes any emotion or value in the process. An example is like *""person X can throw the ball further than me.""* The Ti user doesn't necessarily want that to be true in any way, and might even prefer it not to be true, but nevertheless it is the real truth of the situation. And at the end of the day, that truth is valued more to Ti users than anything else.

Fi logic, by contrast, follows a similar process but instead of excluding values at all cost, they are instead included in the decision making and thinking process. Things like 'good' and 'bad' are included in the thought process, the end result is a correct deduction of the users true values. An example is like *""walking is the best way to lose weight.""* In this example, the user thinks through the options carefully, and perhaps makes pros and cons for each option, maybe even does some calculations to figure out the exact weight loss. But somewhere in the process, something will be given priority over something else due to the users values. 

Perhaps in this example the user may not like swimming as much as walking/running. So walking is a given a very slight edge over swimming. If an Fi user tries to propose that conclusion to Ti users, the Ti users will dislike it because it cannot be considered the real objective truth for everyone. Even other Fi users might disagree and decide that no, swimming is actually the better choice, because they value the water more than land. 

For this reasaon, Fi conclusions can't be applied to other people. And when they do try to claim that their Fi conclusions are true, they will be heavily scrutinized by Ti users for being biased in their thought process. In retaliation, the Fi user will believe that the Ti user is being argumentative, rude and perhaps even closed-minded. The Fi user interprets ""bias"" as an attack on their personal values, because their Fi conclusions **are actually  correct**, it's just that it's **personalised** and only **definitively true for themselves** and not necessarily other people. With Ti, the correct answer not personalised and is the same for every Ti user (assuming no mistakes were made during the thought process).

---------

As for your conclusions being accurate according to your brother as well, it's likely that he is including Fe in his thinking and is being healthy and lenient with the truth. There's no point being 'perfectly correct' if it tarnishes a friendship in the process. This is what Fe believes. A healthy Ti dominant will tend to let the small things go when it comes to checking the accuracy of other peoples ideas and thinking.

(Having said that, I should mention I'm just speculating on the ENFP/ISTP dynamic in my above paragraph, your situation may differ, I don't have enough information to tell with certainty).

(Also he could be using Ni to gauge your perspective and your values, and then agreeing that you are right by seeing things from your perspective rather than his own Ti perspective, something that I do a lot of the time. Again, this is just speculation, please ignore this paragraph if you don't find it useful).",ISTP,637,3622,mbti

1325016,"this is all true. it's an assumption on my part to assume individuals in the IT field have to be smart. I think the intelligence I generally see in the people in my IT department is one of a fluid nature (as opposed to crystallized)), which I struggle with and therefore admire in others. When I say I am academically retarded what I really mean to say is that academics do not and have not ever come naturally or--even with hard work and time--easily to me. I don't exaggerate when I say that you'll probably never meet someone who works harder than I do, and that's been forged out of necessity.   
  
When I finally got officially ADHD tested a couple years back, my IQ was so low that the administrator literally wouldn't tell me what it was. :) Which I always knew about myself, and is the main reason I had avoided such tests until it became a necessity. But the tests I completed were only a slice of the full IQ exam--to be precise they comprised the academic slice--and I was in the 98th percentile for some things and in the 1st percentile for other things, so I'm not completely useless... but pretty close. ;) But that is what I mean when I say 'academically retarded.'   
  
Conversely, the things I'm really great at are utilizing the unique strengths of individuals to better a group or project, understanding the underlying motives people operate from, helping people (typically bosses) figure out exactly what they want to accomplish and then laying out for them what steps they'll need to take to get there, getting tasks organized and completed quickly, etc. In short, I build things. not too surprising of an ISTP who knows how to manage time well and work extremely hard. My hard work is definitely the only thing that has gotten me where I am now, which is into a master's degree in biomedical science, and soon to be PA school. but that only became possible through sacrifice--like spending my nights and summers willfully subjecting myself to remedial math courses just to make sense of what the fuck basic algebra is. haha",ISTP,362,2047,istp

83834,"I'm around women the same way I'm around men. I sense the level of interest and expectations that people have and I adjust my interest and commitment accordingly. In other words if I act disinterested around you, but you can see that I like you, this means that I think you are disinterested and therefore I'm protecting myself from disappointment by setting my expectations low. 

If I'm really interested in you and we have an agreement to meet, I will not prioritise work, friends or family (unless big emergency) and cancel the meeting. If there is a huge emergency and I have to cancel, I will let you know why I cancel and I will propose a different date. When you cancel our meeting without a real emergency and you don't plan for a different date, it tells me that you aren't as interested in me as I am in you. I hate to push people to be more interested in me - it's humiliating. I just accept that it's not going to work and I move on to find somebody who is interested.

593954,"&gt; So introverts, when you see that us extroverts get energized by being around people, how do you feel about that?

To clarify, extroversion isn't so much about being around people for the primary source of energy (that's more in the realm of Dom Fe), but rather the general focus is towards some aspect of the world outside the self.

To be honest, watching an extrovert become so externally engaged for such a long time is entertaining to me yet just as tiring as actually doing it myself. It's like a good movie marathon that I can't just ""turn off"" halfway through the night even though I can barely keep myself awake. 

&gt; how do you all feel going on dates with extroverts?

First of all, I wouldn't limit this question to ""dates/romance"" since it can apply to any relationship with any kind of significant other. 

As for my answer, I enjoy having 1 on 1 time with extroverts as long as they *do not disturb* the moment's ""tranquility"" and/or ""rhythm"". What I would want from extroverts in this scenario is that *they should never try too hard to be themselves* because that's where and how I see the situation getting very awkward very fast.",ISTP,205,1154,mbti
